							<p>American Baptists are a Christ-centered, biblically grounded, ethnically diverse people called to radical personal discipleship in Christ Jesus. Our commitment to Jesus propels us to nurture authentic relationships with one another; build healthy churches; transform our communities, our nations, and our world; engage every member in hands-on ministry; and speak the prophetic word in love.</p>
							<p>
							First Baptist is open to people with backgrounds from all denominations. We are a Bible-based congregation that welcomes those from various Christian backgrounds. We are a theologically diverse congregation, but all submit to the authority of Scripture in our lives.</p>

						<p>There are two types of membership at First Baptist. You can become a full member or an associate member. <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse-membership">more</a></p>
						<div class="collapse" id="collapse-membership">
							<p>To join Muncie First Baptist Church a person normally will present himself/herself for membership by coming forward at the end of a worship service when the pastor invites people to join the church. Any person who professes faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior may be admitted for membership by making your profession of faith in Jesus Christ public and following that with baptism,by transferring your membership from another church or by stating that you are a Christian and have been a member of a church, but for some reason transfer of a letter from that church is unlikely.</p>
							<p>Although Muncie First Baptist Church only baptizes by immersion, the church accepts as valid baptism any form of believer’s baptism. If a person was baptized as a infant, the church accepts that baptism as valid if the individual has completed some form of a catechism class. If not, the church requires that the individual be baptized as a believer.</p>
							<p>Any believer who is temporarily living in the Muncie community may unite with Muncie First Baptist Church during the individual’s stay in Muncie and retain membership in his/her home church. Traditionally, college students have joined as associate members. An Associate Member has no vote on church matters and may not hold elected positions, but may attend church meetings, may assume some positions of leadership, and is invited to participate in all church activities. Such membership terminates upon completion of his/her temporary stay.</p>
