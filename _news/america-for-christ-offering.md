"Healing Communities" is this year's theme for America for Christ. This theme is based on Galatians 6:9â€“10. 
*Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of the believers (NIV).*
During the month of March, First Baptist Church will be collecting freewill financial donations during our Sunday worship services. Giving envelopes will be located in the back of each church pew and can be placed in the offering plates during the service. Your gracious donations will be sent to America for Christ and will impact thousands of people through various ministries:
disaster relief; prisoner reentry programs; immigration; refugee resettlement;
public witness and advocacy;
resources that equip Christian leaders; 
chaplains who bring comfort to those who are ill; 
rebuilding, restoring, and renewing Puerto Rico;
scholarship funds for emerging leaders; and so much more. 
I do hope you will consider giving to help such a wonderful organization that our church has decided to support. *Brian Green*
