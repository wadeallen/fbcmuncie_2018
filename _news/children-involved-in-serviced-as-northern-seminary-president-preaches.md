## Save the Date  
On **Sunday, March 8**, we will gather in a special combined service at **10:45 AM** as we welcome the president of Northern Seminary. Dr. William D. Shiell is the eleventh President of Northern Seminary, where he also serves as Professor of Pastoral Theology and Preaching. A native of Pensacola, Florida, Dr. Shiell holds degrees from Samford University (B.A.) and Baylor University (M. Div., Ph.D.). As we continue our Lenten series, Bill will be focusing on Jesus' teaching from Matthew on Children. The children's ministry team is working to involve children in this special day of worship. We are planning a Church Friends' Lunch following the service.
