On **Sunday, December 15**, children in preschool to 5th grade are invited to stay after church for an afternoon of Christmas caroling!  We will have a pizza lunch immediately following second service downstairs in the lower auditorium then head to a local nursing home (to be determined) to sing a handful of Christmas songs to the residents.  Parents are welcome to join us for lunch then caravan over to the nursing home.  The kids will also be delivering small decorated pots with poinsettias around the nursing home!  This is sure to put smiles on many faces!  Please see Dawn Dawson or Britney Sue with any questions.
