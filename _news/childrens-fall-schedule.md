With our college mentees back from summer break, we will be starting our new fall schedule for children today (September 8)! Sunday School will take place during first service for children in preschool through fifth grade. Preschoolers ages 3–4 will be with Miss Jenny in the preschool room. Children in grades kindergarten through second grade will be with Miss Sydney in the downstairs classroom, and third through fifth graders will be with Miss Randi in the sunken room. During second service, children in grades **kindergarten through fifth** are invited to join us for Children’s Church downstairs with Miss Sydney and Miss Randi. We’re looking forward to a great year learning and growing together!
