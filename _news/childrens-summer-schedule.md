ALL children’s classes, birth through 5th grade, will meet during the second service. Nothing changes for the babies and toddlers. Children pre-K through 5th grade will start in the sanctuary and will be dismissed by Wade as usual, and a helper will walk them downstairs. They will have a short worship time of their own, then break up into age-appropriate groups. The worship time they have together will take the place of the children’s choir time. They will work on a song in class to perform at the end of summer!
