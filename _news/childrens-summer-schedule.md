title: Children's Summer Schedule
weight: 3

We want to let you know of our new summer schedule for the children! With our mentees taking some (much deserved!) time off, we are shuffling things up a bit.




For the next few months (May–July), we will not have Sunday school classes for pre-K through 5th grade during first service. Child care will be provided for ages birth through 3 years with Joyce and Dave as usual. And we will also be providing child care for ages pre-K through 2nd grade, who are just a little too young to sit through the service every week. They can be dropped off downstairs in the Sunday School room. Please note: This is only child care—a place for them to play during the service; there will be no lesson during this time.




We will have ALL children’s classes, birth through 5th grade, during the second service. Nothing changes for the babies and toddlers. Children pre-K through 5th grade will start in the sanctuary and will be dismissed by Wade as usual, and a helper will walk them downstairs. They will have a short worship time of their own, then break up into age-appropriate groups. The worship time they have together will take the place of the children’s choir time. They will work on a song in class to perform at the end of summer!
