Through the month of November, First Baptist Church and Christian Ministries have been teaming up to gather NEW pairs of tube socks to be provided to children, women, and men during the cold winter months ahead. Our goal is to gather at least 300 pairs of socks, and **we need your help.** Please bring your donations to the designated tote in the church office **by next Sunday, December 1**. Socks should be of cotton blend in any color, but preferably white, gray, or black for men/women, and white or multicolor for children. This is a great way to support our community during the winter months! If you have any questions, please contact Brian Green (second service) or Steve Reid (first service). **Thank you for your donations.** *Brian Green*
