Can you imagine surviving the winter months without warm socks?  Me either! November 1st-30th, First Baptist Church and Christian Ministries are teaming up to gather NEW pairs of tube socks for children, women and men.  Christian Ministries currently have sleeping rooms for men and for families. They would like to provide these individuals with clean warm socks for the cold winter months ahead.  All socks should be of cotton blend in any color, preferably white, grey and black for men/women, also white or multicolor for children.  Our goal is to gather at least 300 pairs of socks.  Please bring your donations to the church office, where a designated tote will be provided.  This is a great way to support our community during the winter months.  If you have any questions, please contact Brian Green (Second service) or Steve Reid (First service).
Thank You for Your Donations
