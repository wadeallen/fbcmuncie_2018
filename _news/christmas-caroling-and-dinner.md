The First Baptist Church and Riverside Avenue Baptist Church Caroling, Dinner, and Program (Paul White) will be **Sunday, December 8**. Caroling starts at 3:30 PM and Dinner is served at 6:00 PM. The program will follow dinner. Meat, drinks, and table service will be furnished. Please bring a dish or two to share. You may come to all or any part of the three-part evening. This is for everyone and is another way to meet new friends. If you plan to go caroling, please contact Jane Patton or Terry Harke. This helps us set up groups to visit our shut-ins.






[a]I assume she means to say that the price includes this, but nowhere does it actually say what the cost is. Add?
