There will be a business meeting on **Sunday, September 9**, between services in the Lower Auditorium. The CCT will present some personnel/scheduling changes that will occur as Worship Pastor Dr. Clif Davis assumes a new position at Taylor University and decreases his time at First Baptist. In addition, church members will be asked to vote on people who have joined the church in the past few months.
