title: Church Friends Lunch Coming Up on May 5
weight: 5
---

On **Sunday, May 5**, after second service, FBC attenders are invited to attend our fourth “Church Friends Lunch” at By Hand and Fork restaurant, 1617 North Wheeling. Our group will have the patio room, which holds up to 80 people. There will be about ten minutes of get-acquainted activities and then opportunities for everyone to order breakfast or lunch entrees off the menu.
 
Someone who attended all three of our activities last year said, “I have been a member of First Baptist for almost fifteen years, but I haven’t known many people in the other service that well. These events have been a wonderful way to put names with faces and to fellowship with others that love First Baptist like I do.”
 
Get this on your calendar and watch your email. A reservation link will be going out after April 15 so that you may sign up. In addition, signups will be taken in the church office or over the phone.
