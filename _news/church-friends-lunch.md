On **Sunday, May 5**, following second service, people will gather in the patio room at By Hand and Fork for special fellowship at the fourth “Church Friends Lunch.” The restaurant is at 1617 N. Wheeling and will accommodate up to 80 of our church family.   You can register at [http://bit.ly/friends-lunch](http://bit.ly/friends-lunch).  If you do not use a computer, you may call the church office to be added to the list for lunch. This time to eat and fellowship also comes with a couple of brief exercises to help people get to know each other better.
