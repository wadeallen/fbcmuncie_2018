The next Church Friends Lunch will be **Sunday, October 28**, after second service. We'll be meeting at the MCL Cafeteria in the Muncie Mall. MCL has given us some pretty specific instructions to follow. Their banquet room holds **55 people**, so that will be the cap on the number of folks who can attend. They have a policy that no outside food or drink can be brought into the room; anything eaten there needs to be purchased from MCL. As with our time at Mancino's last March, you will go through the line, pay for your own food, and then meet up with the group in the banquet room. **The deadline to register for this event is Friday, October 26**. Please register  [online](http://bit.ly/fbc-octlunch), or call Julie Davis and she will help you. We hope you can join your FBC friends for this event!
