title: Church Friends' Lunch
weight: 3

Today, after the combined service, the following people will gather in the lower auditorium to share lunch: church friends, the Taylor Gospel Choir members who are singing in our service, and people you donâ€™t know from both services. As we get ready to go through the serving line, there will be a very brief activity to get to know others, and then attendees will have a lasagna (meat or veggie) lunch. The only other requirement is that when you arrive you stop next to the serving table to pick up a nametag. That is a prerequisite for sharing in this lunch!
