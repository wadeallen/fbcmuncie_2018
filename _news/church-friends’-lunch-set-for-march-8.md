title: Church Friends’ Lunch Set for March 8
weight: 3
---

On **Sunday, March 8**, after the combined service, the following people will gather in the lower auditorium to share lunch: church friends, the Taylor Gospel Choir members who will sing in our service, and people you don’t know from both services. As we get ready to go through the serving line, there will be a very brief activity to get to know others and then attendees will have a lasagna (meat or veggie) lunch. Bring a dessert, but everything else will be furnished. Sign up in the office or online. The only other requirement is that when you arrive you stop next to the serving table to pick up a nametag. That is a prerequisite for sharing in this lunch!




**Reservations are required**. Register online  [here](http://bit.ly/Marchfriends_lunch) or   call the church office **by Wednesday, March 4**, to reserve a spot. See you there!
