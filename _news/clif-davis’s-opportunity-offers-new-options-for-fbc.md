Dr. Clif Davis, our Worship Arts Pastor, has signed a full-time contract to teach at Taylor University. We are happy for Clif and his opportunity and are pleased that it has potential to evolve into a permanent position.
This does, however, create some challenges for us during the transition. While Clif has worked four units (approximately twenty hours per week) in the past, his new Taylor University responsibilities will require that he devote two units (approximately ten hours per week) to oversee the worship and music of First Baptist.
Looking at many options, the Church Coordination Team has helped Clif, Pastor Wade, and Worship Ministry Coordinator Adam Fink look at ways in which Clif can serve and lead so that there is no interruption in the leadership of the Sanctuary Choir and the Praise Band along with the rest of the worship experience. In addition, a random selection of regular attendees have participated in a focus group to offer ideas for restructuring Clif’s role. As might be imagined, relying on mentees, talented college upperclassmen who are music majors, is one way that this change will be facilitated.
Please be willing to pray about these changes, to step up to handle tasks with which lay people can assist, and to use the change we may notice to strengthen our worship together. We will keep everyone posted as we evolve to a new normal.
