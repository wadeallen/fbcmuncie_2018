Each year the pastors receive a Christmas gift from the congregation and church. If you would like to contribute to a gift for Wade’s family (pastor), Clif’s family (worship arts pastor) or Bruce’s family (first service worship director), please give cash or a check made out to First Baptist Church. Contributions may be given to Bill Eidson, Dan Lemen, Ray Conley or Molly Flodder.
