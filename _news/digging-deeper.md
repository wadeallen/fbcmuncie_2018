As we dig deeper in "Joining God in the Neighborhood" there will be many opportunities to go to places that provide services, to learn what their contributions are and, at a few, to volunteer briefly and get a feel for their work. On Wednesday evening, **July 24**, several of those organizations will come to us instead. The whole church is invited to come for supper at **5:30 PM**, and then there will be mini-presentations by a variety of organizations ranging from Alpha Center and Main Street Methodist Church to Children's Clothing Center. Childcare will be provided, and the event will end around 7:00. Sign up for any of the 12 opportunities on the bulletin board or by calling the church office. If each of us attends two events, we can promise our hosts very good interest in their work.
