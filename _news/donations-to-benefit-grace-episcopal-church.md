Grace Episcopal Church, our neighbor down Adams Street, feeds between 70 and 110 people every Sunday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Afterward, many of the people at the meal stay for a prayer and devotional time. The ministry has been going on for more than a decade and meets an important need in our community.  
 
FBC has created the "Can Project" and is collecting institutional-sized cans of varying vegetables to share with them for Sunday meals. These large-quantity items are available at Walmart, Mid-States Concessions on Burlington, and at GFS in Anderson. Please bring them to the church office by **April 19**.
