We are grateful for the DVD ministry which is primarily organized by Duane Davis. In 2019, 149 DVDs were delivered or mailed. 34 extra DVDs were published. 50 DVDs were placed in the archives and 94 visits were made to shut ends who did not wish to receive a DVD. This important ministry helps those who are unable to attend church take part in the service. If you'd be interested in helping with this ministry, contact Duane Davis.
