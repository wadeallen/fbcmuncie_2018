We are grateful for the DVD ministry that is primarily organized by Duane Davis. In 2019, 149 DVDs were delivered or mailed. Thirty-four extra DVDs were published. Fifty DVDs were placed in the archives, and ninety-four visits were made to shut-ins who did not wish to receive a DVD. This important ministry helps those who are unable to attend church take part in the service. If you'd be interested in helping with this ministry, contact Duane Davis.
