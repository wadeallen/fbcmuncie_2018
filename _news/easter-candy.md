Easter is right around the corner, and we are in need of candy donations for our annual children's Easter Egg Hunt! Please drop off your candy donations to the church office anytime between now and March 29. We kindly ask that all candy be individually wrapped, please. The Easter Egg Hunt will be on **Saturday, April 4**, in the morning. More information will be available in the April Visitor. Thank you! *The Children's Ministry Team*
