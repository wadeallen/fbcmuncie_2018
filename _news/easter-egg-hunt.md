The Children's Ministry Team is kicking off spring with our annual Easter Egg Hunt! Grab your baskets and join us at Morrow's Meadow in Yorktown on **Saturday, April 20**, at **10:00 AM**. Plastic bags will be provided to take home all that yummy candy! Donuts and juice will also be served. When the children are done with the egg hunt, they are welcome to play on one of the two playgrounds at the park. Please park in the parking lot next to Pizza King and close to the playground for younger kids. We will be set up close to the small pavilion area next to that playground. We look forward to seeing everyone there!
