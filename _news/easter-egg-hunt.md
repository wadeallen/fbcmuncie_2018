The Children's Ministry Team is kicking off spring with our annual Easter Egg Hunt! Grab your baskets and join us on **Saturday, April 20, 10 AM** at Tuhey Park. Plastic bags will be provided to take home all that yummy candy! Donuts and juice will also be served. When the children are done with the egg hunt, they are welcome to play on the playground at the park. We look forward to seeing everyone there!
