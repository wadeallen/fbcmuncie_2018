Family Game Night will take place **Saturday, June 22** from **4:30-7:30 PM** in the church parking lot. Church members and their families, YWCA residents and staff, and invited guests are invited to engage in some friendly competition with our larger than life “board” games! A dinner of hot dogs, chips, drinks, and cookies will be provided. Please be sure to register for the event to ensure we have enough food for everyone. **You may register via link or fill out the bottom of the flyer and return to the collection plate**. In the case of bad weather, we will move to the YWCA gym. We hope to see you there!  To register [click here](http://bit.ly/fbc-family-night).
