The Children's Ministry Team is hosting a family game night at the church on **Saturday June 22** from **4:30 to 7:30 PM** in the lower auditorium!  Grab the kids and a game or two to share for a fun night of friendly competition!  We will be providing dinner (pizza, drinks, and cookies!), so please make sure to register for this event to ensure we have plenty of food for everyone.  An email with the registration link will be sent before the event.  It's going to be a fun evening!  Hope to see you there! --- The Children's Ministry Team
