Beginning this school year, Worship Arts Pastor Dr. Clif Davis has a full-time one-year contract to teach at Taylor University. Given his time constraints, he has amended his contribution at First Baptist Church to be two units rather than four, still overseeing and coordinating worship for the church and focusing primarily on contemporary music for the second service.
 
The church has hired Dr. Bruce McFarland at two units per week to conduct the sanctuary choir and lead worship in the first service. Bruce is joined by his wife, Paula, who plans to volunteer often to accompany the choir. Dr. McFarland completed his doctoral program in music in May of this year. He and Paula have been in the area five years and reside in Yorktown.
 
The McFarlands grew up in New York state and received their undergraduate training there. They spent almost twenty years in service to the Wycliffe Bible Translators in Papua New Guinea, where Bruce served as a music teacher. They came to the Muncie area from service in Rochester, New York.
 
Bruce and Paula are parents of six children and grandparents of four grandchildren. Their four oldest children are Rebecca, Ruth, Sarah, and Paul and they live in New Hampshire, Chicago, Brooklyn and Maryland, respectively. The two younger children, Peter and Anna, are in college at University of Miami and at Indiana Wesleyan.
 
Bruce said, “Bach said that the purpose of music was to ‘glorify God and uplift mankind.'  We are so pleased to be of service at First Baptist Church and to try to do just that!”
