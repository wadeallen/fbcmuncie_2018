This summer we had an opportunity to visit and learn more about our neighbor Christian Ministries. 




Christian Ministries has a long history in Muncie, serving those in need within our community. You may be aware of their men’s homeless shelter that is open during the fall and winter months, but did you know that they also offer temporary housing for families in need? Christian Ministries also provides for other needs. They have a food pantry, thrift store (with proceeds going toward programs of services of Christian Ministries), emergency assistance for persons who are in need of paying rent or utilities before eviction or utilities are shut off, a blanket cupboard, and baby care, as well as school and Christmas assistance.  




First Baptist has a long history with Christian Ministries. Not only have we continuously given a percentage of our funds to their ministry in support, we have a history of volunteering with their ministry. Numerous individuals have helped over the years by giving financially and donating food and other items.   




Do you want to be more involved or learn more about this important ministry and neighbor? We will have a monthly opportunity to assist in providing meals for the men’s shelter starting this October. This will continue through the fall and winter.  Check the bulletin board outside of the sanctuary for ways that you can participate in supporting Christian Ministries.
