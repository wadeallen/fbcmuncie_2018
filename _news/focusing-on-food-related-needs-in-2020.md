title: Focusing on Food-Related Needs in 2020

*By MaryAnne Bayer, Outreach Ministries*  








In July, around fifty people in our church participated in Joining God in the Neighborhood: Digging Deeper. It was a chance for everyone to look at most of the services available within a half mile radius of our church to see what services are out there, how the need was identified, and how programs were established. We also saw the efforts that operate to maintain these activities in our community.  
 
In moving forward to see where God is calling First Baptist to serve, it may be important to start at the bottom of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. The lowest platform is physiological needs: air, water, food, rest, and health. We cannot simply encourage struggling people to invite Christ into their lives or move up the ladder of needs to help them to find more affordable housing, get a job, or build a budget. It is our responsibility as Christians also to be concerned whether their basic needs are being met and discover how we can help.  
 
Last summer, we examined several organizations whose work relates to providing food:  


- Christian Ministries provides colder season suppers to the men in the sleeping room as well as a food pantry.
- Grace Episcopal Church serves a Sunday afternoon meal.
- Muncie Soup Kitchen serves a hot lunch and a sack supper Monday through Friday each week. 4) Main Street Methodist Church, a ministry of Gethsemane at the Garden Church, serves a Sunday lunch meal.
- Friends Church runs a food pantry.
- Blood ‘n Fire has a food pantry and a Saturday evening meal.
- Forward STEPS (formerly TEAMwork for Quality Living) serves a weekly meal on Thursday nights in our Lower Auditorium.  




In 2020, the Outreach Team will divide the year into thirds and concentrate each four-month period on particular ministries, all the while learning and sharing about food insecurity, free and reduced lunch rates in our schools, grocery deserts, and who actually comes to receive food and why.




## First January–April Opportunity 










We have already started by volunteering to bring dinner to the men in the Christian Ministries Sleeping Room once a month. There is a sign-up sheet where several have already committed to help, and we can use more. Please check the bulletin board in the hallway outside the sanctuary. 










## Second January–April Opportunity 














Also from January through April, we want to provide food to Grace Episcopal Church for their Sunday afternoon dinners. They serve a hot meal to 85–120 people each week.  Ann Heilman, a member of our church, is one of their regular volunteers. Situated in a small church kitchen, the group finds they can most easily open, cook, and serve institutional-sized cans for their side dishes. It takes about four large cans to feed the group any particular food, such as green beans, corn, mixed vegetables, etc.  We will put up a box in the church office, and we need you to fill it with cans.  Bring four, if you’d like, or team up with a family member or friend to get four of the same kind of food. These are available at Walmart stores, Midstates Concessions on South Burlington, and Gordon Food Service in Anderson, to name a few locations.  










 


Other work that is already going on will not change—the pillowcase project, Christmas Shoebox project, Hearts and Hands Back-to-School initiative, etc. Again, the bulletin board is the place to see these and other opportunities.
