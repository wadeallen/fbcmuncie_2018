*By MaryAnne Bayer, Outreach Ministry*  
 
As we focus on how we can "Join God in the Neighborhood" to meet the needs of those around us, our church is focusing on food insufficiency during 2020.  Food insufficiency is distinguished by restricted household food stores and too little food intake among adults or children in the household,
 
>In spite of a country full of wealth and privilege, food insufficiency is an issue.  On the topic of food insufficiency in children, according to the Brookings Institute, “Despite improvements across a number of economic indicators, rates of child experience of and exposure to food insecurity have failed to see reductions. In 2017, 17.0 percent of children in the United States—totaling 12.5 million children—experienced food insecurity. This means that they lived in a household that at some point during the year did not have consistent access to adequate food due to a lack of money or other resources.  
 
In Indiana, that percentage is 16.3, a little lower than the national number, but in Muncie, with one in five children living in poverty, that number is higher.  
 
Several services in our community attempt to address food insufficiency, and we are working to help some of them.  There are two opportunities for this first quarter: 
 
1. HELP NEEDED:  We are to furnish meals to the men’s sleeping room several more times before warm weather comes.  Two snowbirds handled the first few dinners—meals for 15-20 men.  We need to have others take on this opportunity for the next couple of months.  The sign-up sheet including dates needed is on the bulletin board in the main hallway.  Please let Patti Warner know that you have signed up.  She can answer any questions about this work.
2. INSTITUTIONAL CANS NEEDED:  We are currently collecting institutional sized cans of vegetables for the Grace Episcopal Church dinners on Sunday afternoons.  There are several cans in the office and we could use more. Team up with a family member or friend and bring four of the same kind of food, because it usually takes 3-4 cans to serve the 100+ men, women and children who attend these dinners.  The large cans are available at Walmart, MidStates Concessions (on Burlington) and Gordon Food Service in Anderson. 
 
Stay tuned to "The Visitor" for more opportunities of giving and service in the coming months.  After all, knowing that our neighbors are struggling to meet needs is something that should be of concern to all of us.
