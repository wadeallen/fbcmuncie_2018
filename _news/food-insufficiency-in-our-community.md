As we focus on how we can "Join God in the Neighborhood" to meet the needs of those around us, our church is highlighting food insufficiency during 2020. Food insufficiency is distinguished by restricted household food stores and too little food intake among adults or children in the household.
 
In spite of a country full of wealth and privilege, food insufficiency is an issue.  On the topic of food insufficiency in children, according to the Brookings Institute, Despite improvements across a number of economic indicators, rates of child experience of and exposure to food insecurity have failed to see reductions. In 2017, 17.0 percent of children in the United States—totaling 12.5 million children—experienced food insecurity. This means that they lived in a household that at some point during the year did not have consistent access to adequate food due to a lack of money or other resources.  
 
In Indiana, that percentage is 16.3—a little lower than the national number—but in Muncie, with one in five children living in poverty, that number is higher.  
 
Several services in our community attempt to address food insufficiency, and we are working to help some of them. There are two opportunities for this first quarter: 
 
1. HELP NEEDED: We have been asked to furnish meals for the Men’s Sleeping Room several more times before warm weather comes. Two snowbirds handled the first few dinners—meals for 12–15 men. We need to have others take on this opportunity for the next couple of months. You can simply provide the food, or you can stay to serve it. The sign-up sheet, which includes the dates help is needed, is on the bulletin board in the main hallway. Please let Patti Warner know that you have signed up. She can answer any questions about this work.
2. INSTITUTIONAL CANS NEEDED: We are currently collecting institutional-size cans of vegetables for the Grace Episcopal Church dinners that occur on Sunday afternoons. There are several cans already in the office, and we could use more. Team up with a family member or friend and bring four of the same kind of food, because it usually takes 3–4 cans to serve the 100+ men, women, and children who attend these dinners.  The large cans are available at Walmart, MidStates Concessions (on Burlington), and Gordon Food Service in Anderson. 
 
Stay tuned to *The Visitor* for more opportunities for giving and serving in the coming months.
