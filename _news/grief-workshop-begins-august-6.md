First Baptist Church attendees may be included in a Grief Workshop series being offered at High Street Methodist Church on **Tuesday nights from 6-8 PM** beginning **August 6** and continuing through **September 10**.  The group is being facilitated by Sandra Hardcastle, director of older adult programs at High Street.  The cost of the workshop is $18 to cover the cost of the book “Understanding Your Grief” by Alan Wolfelt. Although Sandra is not a professional counselor, her approach to the class is based on her own experiences with grief and the importance to healing of people sharing their feelings.  










There is room for a few more people in the class, but they will be accepted on a First Come/First Served basis.  There are sign up forms in the office that will be available until the class is filled.
