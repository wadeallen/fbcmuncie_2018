This yearâ€™s Harvest Meal will be held on **November 18**. On that Sunday, we will have a combined service at **10:45 AM**. Following the service we will gather in the lower auditorium for our Harvest Meal. Meat, drinks, and table service will be provided. Please bring a dish or two to share. Also **Saturday November 17** from **10:00 AM to noon** help will be needed to set tables and complete a small amount of food prep. Please contact Barb Campbell  if  you are willing to help.
