This yearâ€™s Harvest Meal will be held on **November 18**. On that Sunday, we will have a combined service at **10:45 AM**. Following the service we will gather in the lower auditorium for our Harvest Meal. Meat, drinks, and table service will be provided. We will have the pleasure of forty Taylor University student's joining us. Please bring a dish or two to share, please adjust your recipes so that we will be able to accommodate them. Also **Saturday November 17** from **10:00 AM to noon** help will be needed to set tables and complete a small amount of food prep. Please contact Barb Campbell  if  you are willing to help.
