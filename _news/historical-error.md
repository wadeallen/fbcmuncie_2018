In last month's visitor, you may have noticed a logo that referenced the 75th year of the Visitor. Based on the volume numbers, it appeared that 2019 was the 75th edition. However, upon further examination this information was incorrect. The Visitor began in January 1947. Somehow the volume numbers were incorrect in 2004 and again in 2012. In order to fix this oversight, this edition will be volume 73, issue 2. We will celebrate the 75th anniversary in a few years.
