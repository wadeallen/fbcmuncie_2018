Last Sunday you found out about a remarkable way you can let your light shine in 2019 and beyond. As individuals, we are planning to tell our personal faith stories. Then, as a whole, First Baptist can reflect on and share the good work God is doing in our lives.




“But,” you ask me, “how do I start?”




That’s a great question! I would encourage you to begin by getting quiet for a few minutes. Yes, put your phone in the other room for a while—we all need a break from that. Sit in a place that makes you feel comfortable and relaxed. And start by asking God for help. Do you remember this prayer that Pastor Wade shared with us last summer?




*"Lord, I am open to the Holy Spirit. Come to me, dwell in me, speak to me so that I may become more like Christ. Lord, give me the courage to be open. Lord, I am open to the Holy Spirit. Come, Holy Spirit. Amen."*




The Holy Spirit can help us understand how God has worked in our lives in the past and is working now. But it takes courage to be open, to listen. Ask for that courage, and for the Spirit to help you understand how God has been at work in you. It may be that the Spirit will begin bringing thoughts to your mind right away, but if not, that’s okay. You’re open to listening for the Spirit to speak.




To move your thought process forward, take some time to see if one of these ideas resonates with you:




- Have you seen something happen that can only be explained as a “God thing”?
- Do you have family members or friends? What would you like them to know about your spiritual journey?
- Have you gone through something very difficult and been changed for the better?
- Has God ever given you a promise and you’ve seen it come true?
- How are you different today than you were a year ago?  3 years ago?  5 years ago? 
- If you had the opportunity to tell a very good friend about something God has done for you in the past, what would you tell them?
- Has there been a special Scripture verse or passage that helped you through a difficult time?
- Is there a way the discernment process used at FBC has changed you or the work you do in the church?
- Is there a way that being a part of this congregation in Muncie has changed your life, impacted your spiritual growth, etc.?
- Have you recently come to know Christ?  How is your life different?  What are some of the challenges?  What are some of the joys you've found in coming to know Christ?




Even if you can just jot down a few thoughts today, it’s a start. Another day you can work on it more. And if you get stuck, there are upcoming opportunities to get help from the Story Project Team. Please attend one of our one-hour information meetings on **Sunday, February 24**, or **Sunday, March 3**. We’ll also have a longer workshop here at church the morning of **Saturday, March 16**. Team members will be here to help you one-on-one with the story you want to tell. You’ve got something to say!
