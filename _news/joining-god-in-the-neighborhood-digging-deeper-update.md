title: Joining God in the Neighborhood Digging Deeper Update
weight: 3
---

This summer we explored many wonderful ministries in our neighborhood. In August, the team leaders met to discover what we have learned during this process, to discern where God is at work and to decide how we can be involved. We received feedback from those who participated, and we learned that as a church we would like to have a stronger focus in a ministry area, to give FBC a purpose in outreach.  In 2020, we will kick off a year of focus.  Our focus will be on food in our neighborhood.  Plan on being involved and engaging as we join God in providing this basic need in our neighborhood.  More information to come. 










We at FBC have several opportunities to share our care. We have 7 opportunities coming up now that each of you can choose at least one to participate.
