Thank you to all who participated in our Joining God in the Neighborhood Digging Deeper in July. We found God and our neighbors reaching out to the neighbors in many different ways. We also had a luncheon on August 11 in which people shared what each agency was doing so we might be able to develop a vision for what Muncie FBC could be doing. There was an opportunity to visit twelve different agencies, and then six came to us to share with us on a Wednesday evening. You will be hearing more in another month or two.
