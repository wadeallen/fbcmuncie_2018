Thank you to all who participated in our Joining God in the Neighborhood Digging Deeper in July. We found God and our neighbors reaching out to the neighbors in many different ways. We also had a luncheon on August 11 that people shared what each agency was doing so we might be able to vision what MIFBC could be doing. There was an opportunity to visit 12 different agencies and then 6 came to us to share on a Wednesday evening. You will be hearing more in another month or two.
