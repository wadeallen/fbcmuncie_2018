title: Joining God in the Neighborhood Wrap-Up Lunch
weight: 4
---

On **August 11** after the second service, we will gather for a simple lunch in the lower auditorium to celebrate the culmination of our knowledge and visits in July. It will be a time that we ask what the neighborhood has taught us and discern what God wants us to do.  
   
We would ask that you sign up today if you plan to attend. There will be a sign up sheet on the bulletin board or you may also call the church office to make reservations. Our Barb Campbell and friends will make a wonderful taco salad or nachos with ice cream for dessert. Hope to see those who attended our Digging Deeper events as well as others interested in discussing the outreach of our church.
