For the past several Sundays, we have discussed our vision for Joining God in the Neighborhood: Digging Deeper. For the weeks of **July 14-27**, we have the opportunity to learn about and/or serve with one of our “neighbors“. Pray about where God may be leading you to serve. Then commit to at least one. We also encourage you to invite a friend, neighbor, relative, etc to do it with you! You can sign up at church. Read more about specific dates and times at  [Download brochure here](/jgitn).
