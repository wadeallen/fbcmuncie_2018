As mentioned in last month’s *Visitor*, FBC will continue the Joining God in the Neighborhood program. The purpose is to allow a time of discovery and discernment of our current and future neighborhood needs. We will learn how God is still at work meeting needs in our neighborhood. We will have a two-week focus on Digging Deeper from **July 14–27, 2019** that will provide opportunities to learn about our neighborhood, the various ministries and services that are already being provided, and also opportunities to serve our neighbors. This time will be different from the work sessions we did in the summer of 2017. The Joining God in the Neighborhood Team feels it is important not just to pray for or help out an organization, but really work to learn how it came about and what its mission, clients, and services are all about. At the end of the two weeks of experiences, there will be an opportunity for feedback and for people to express whether FBC can do anything more to join God in the neighborhood. It is our hope that we as a church congregation will choose to collectively become a stakeholder in our neighborhood and individually become involved and invested in our neighborhood.

Events will then officially begin on **Sunday, July 14**, after church. This first event will begin with a bring-your-own-lunch picnic in our church parking lot. After we eat there will be an optional walking tour, led by one of our own historians, James Heimlich, around the downtown historic districts. During the tour, James will teach us how First Baptist Church was historically placed in the downtown area. We will see how the downtown has been revitalized and repurposed from its historical use to become the community that is our neighborhood today. After the optional walking tour, there will be a presentation at the church to further discuss the history of our church’s neighborhood, what it is today, and what the future holds for the neighborhood and our church.






























The rest of the two weeks will be filled with near-daily opportunities to visit and learn about some aspect of our neighborhood and something that is going on there. For example, we will go to Price Hall on Madison Street to hear from the Muncie Housing Authority and to learn about public housing in our community. Following our learning about the housing developments and how people qualify for Section 8 housing, we will tour a housing unit in Millennium Place, formerly Munsyanna Homes.
























Please join us in prayer for the weeks ahead as we prepare to Dig Deeper into what God is doing in our neighborhood. It is our hope and desire that everyone will participate in at least two or three opportunities over the course of the event. More details are coming soon.
