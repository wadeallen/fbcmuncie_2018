A little while ago, we participated in Joining God in the Neighborhood.  We did this through prayer walks in our neighborhood, volunteering at local ministries, and learning about community programs from guest speakers. If you recall, Joining God in the Neighborhood is a national program in which churches in the American Baptist Association are participating.  We often focus on what our own church is doing for others and do not take the opportunity to see what is already occurring in our community. As we seek to help others and love our neighbors in the name of Christ, we don’t have to do everything ourselves.  It can feel like a daunting and overwhelming task, but God is already at work taking care of the needs in our community.  Joining God in the Neighborhood helps us recognize that:
















1. God is already ahead of us, and active in our neighborhoods. 
2. All the clues for how to join with God in your communities are already among the people of a local congregation.
3. We continually ask: “Where are we being called to join with what God is up to in our neighborhoods?
4. We are shaped by a desire to know and pay attention to the stories of the people in our neighborhood.
5. We are cultivating new practices of local Christian life that give us fresh insights into God’s work in our local contexts (American Baptist Churches USA 2015).






We are doing this by finding opportunities to discover our neighborhood in new ways and investing in what is going on.  This is done through the following process:








## Listen 






To God and one another through Scripture (Dwelling in the Word) to your neighborhoods.






## Discern 




Bring your listening together to discern where God is already at work in your neighborhood and how you might join God in that work.








## Experiment 








Create several experiments in joining God in the neighborhood.








## Reflect 






Together as a congregation on what you have discovered in the experimenting.








## Decide 






To create new experiments inviting more people in the congregation to join with you (American Baptist Churches USA 2015).






This summer we will continue to Join God in the Neighborhood through new opportunities.  In July we will have a two-week period, July 15-27, where FBC will provide opportunities for individuals, groups, and families to discover more of what God is already doing in our communities. There will be opportunities to do tours and gather information about community organizations.  There will also be opportunities to join with some of these organizations and serve the community with them. It is our hope at FBC that everyone will participate during this event so that we can continue to serve God in our neighborhood in new and exciting ways. There will be more information forthcoming in the weeks ahead.  If you have any questions or ideas regarding this, feel free to talk to James Heimlich or MaryAnne Bayer.
