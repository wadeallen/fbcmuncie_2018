As we study the book of Revelation, it will be important to stay up to date with the study. If you miss a week or two, you might find it hard to make sense of how it all fits together. Let me encourage you to take the time to listen to the podcast or watch the sermon videos online. However, with the technology that we have available, you can keep up each week and get the most out of this study.
