Please remember to label any refrigerated opened food with the name of the group and the date opened.  Refrigerators are cleaned monthly and unlabeled items will be removed.  Personal items may be stored in the office refrigerator.






To avoid dried food being left on pans and utensils, please do clean-up ASAP after preparing food. Thank you. The Kitchen Team
