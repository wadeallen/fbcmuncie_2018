At the moment we have more than $95,000.00 in the Legacy Campaign fund. We will find out any day now about the signage matching grant. If you have not checked out the music room upstairs, please do. The exterior wall was fixed so the walls could be repaired and painted. It is again an attractive room.  Before yearâ€™s end, you will see the results of interior and exterior signage to make our church more welcoming and accessible.
Next month will be the beginning of the second year of the campaign. This is when we expect your second check if you are giving one check a year. Please plan to bring your check on October 28 or November 4 to make it easier to compile annual gifts.
