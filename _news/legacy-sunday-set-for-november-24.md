As our building turns 90, our church turns 160 and our three-year Legacy Capital Campaign comes to a close, we are taking the occasions to celebrate the legacy of our church and appreciate the gifts of people and service that have been given to bring First Baptist Church to where it is.  
While we have a beautiful building, our Legacy is not just about the beauty or the history of our building.  It is about looking at everyone who comes together to serve the Lord and work in His church, everyone who is building a strong today as a foundation for a stronger tomorrow.   
On **Sunday, November 24**, in a combined service, we will celebrate Legacy Sunday with an eye toward where we have been, where we are, and where we are going.  There will be opportunity to appreciate everyone who has played a role in the operation, development and building the future of our church as well as to point out a few people who have played long-term roles in several particular areas such as administration, Christian education, and worship.   
After the service, we will all participate in the “Harvest Dinner.”  This will be a carry-in and, because we expect some extra guests, we will need each household to bring a family-sized side dish or dessert to add to the turkey, ham, and drinks, already being provided.   
A team effort is coming together to unveil this wonderful opportunity.  In addition to teams working with Pastor Wade, Clif Davis and Bruce McFarland on the service, Barb Campbell (Member Care Ministry) will need a lot of help in setting up, serving and cleaning up for the dinner.  Please call Barb  or  leave a message in the church office, if you are willing to help.
