FBC has three small groups as well as a women’s prayer group that are moving into their 2020 initiatives.  






 
The first group has hit their limit on members if they are to remain a “small group” but will let the church know if any openings occur. They typically study a serial program such as a book of the Bible or a book.  






 
The second group is reorganizing and will be recruiting people and making decisions about their area of focus. The group has been in place for a few years, but a few members of the group have recently moved away. See James or Michelle Heimlich, or Mark or Britney Sue, if you have an interest in joining this group. In addition, if you wish to put together a small group that has not been meeting, that is an option, too.  






 
Each of the previous groups are starting up early in the year and meet in a “spring semester” / ”fall semester” time frame, taking the summers off.   












 
The third Life Group is our “Warm Weather” group. This group, which includes several snowbird members, meets from May through October. The Warm Weather group—because most of the members are retired and travel frequently—has stand-alone programs or short series focusing on community services, Christian discipleship, or current topics, ranging from grief to disaster relief.


    








 
All three of these groups meet twice monthly. Either refreshments or a meal is typically served. Currently the first group meets two Sunday evenings a month and the Warm Weather group meets on the second and fourth Thursdays. The group now recruiting has not set their final meeting times.  






 
Although there is not childcare provided in these groups, this is something that will be addressed as we move forward.  








 
Finally, the women’s prayer group, which is currently sharing prayer, favorite Bible verses, and discussion, is made up of two women from the first service and three from the second. They meet for lunch at 11:30 AM on the first and third Mondays of each month (except holidays). Place is determined on a session-by-session basis. Contact Julie Kirklin if you have questions or an interest in joining the group.   








 
If you have additional questions, please contact  me or Julie Davis.
