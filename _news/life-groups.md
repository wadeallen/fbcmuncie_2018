Our life groups offer an opportunity for adults to learn together and support each other in a casual, welcoming environment. We have two life groups meeting at the moment, and two additional life groups will reconvene in late August. The groups meet roughly two times per month in either a restaurant or someone's home, and the format of each group varies. If you talk with any one of our current life group members, you'll find they're so glad they chose to join a group.




**Our life groups are accepting new members**. Would you like to find out more? Please see Julie Davis.
