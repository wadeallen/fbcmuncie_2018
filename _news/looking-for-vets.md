If you are someone you know in our church is a veteran, please bring a picture of that person in service with dates and rank to MaryAnne Bayer. MaryAnne volunteers at the church office on Monday afternoons. You can leave it at the office addressed to her. We need the pictures on or before October 8. We will honor our vets on November 11  .
