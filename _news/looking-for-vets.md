First Baptist plans to honor our veterans on November 11. If you or someone you know in our church is a veteran, please bring a picture of that person in uniform (if possible) with dates and rank to MaryAnne Bayer. MaryAnne volunteers at the church office on Monday afternoons, and you can leave it at the office addressed to her. Please submit your pictures on or before October 8. We will honor our vets on November 11  .
