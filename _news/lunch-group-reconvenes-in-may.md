title: Lunch Group Reconvenes in May
weight: 5
---

For the past four years, a group of 4-6 FBC ladies has met regularly for prayer, conversation and lunch.  This has been in addition to a small group or instead of a small group for each group member.
 


“We have taken a break for a few months and will reconvene on Monday, May 6,” said Molly Flodder, a member of the group.  “This has been a chance for us to share concerns or praises with other Christians and has been a blessing to each of us. Although I am retired now, I wasn’t when we first started and this was a way I could be in communication with others when my schedule did not allow me to be in another small group.”


 
The group welcomes anyone (including men) and will meet the **first and third Monday of each month from 11:30-12:30 PM** at a restaurant convenient to downtown. Please watch the bulletin for more information about when and where the group will meet.
