Part of the Church Coordinating Team’s long-term focus when I ended my term as moderator in December was to continue a journey of discernment and experimenting in our community and neighborhood.  Their intention is to learn fresh ways of being God’s missionary people in our neighborhoods, not to necessarily create new work but, over time, to join God’s work that is already happening.
 
Mary Ann Bayer, coordinator of Outreach Ministry, will be heading up a June “Neighborhood Immersion” which will allow many of us to get away from our church and to visit several places within a few blocks of our church where God and our fellow-Munsonians are at work taking care of local needs.
 
This Immersion will give us opportunities to be in several locations in our community, viewing and providing a hand with what is going on.  It will take place over 3-4 days/evenings and will be “ala carte” so that people can participate in what they have the time and interest to do.
 
Stay tuned to next month’s “Visitor”, future bulletins and church announcements as details materialize.
