weight: 3

Our goal is to have a staffed nursery each Sunday, with two adults in the crib room (birth to one year) and one adult in the one-year-old class. To be a nursery volunteer, you simply need to have a background check on file at the church. Please see Britney Sue or Colleen Massoth if you are interested in becoming a nursery volunteer. We would love to have you on our wonderful team of workers!
