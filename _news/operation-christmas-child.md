The childrenâ€™s team is collecting items to fill shoeboxes for Operation Christmas Child. Please drop off your items in the designated boxes in the church office. The deadline to donate is November 11. You can find a list of "do's" and "don'ts" on the bulletin board outside the sanctuary next to the nursery. THANK YOU!
