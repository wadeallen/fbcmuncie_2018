We have agreed to provide one meal a month for the Men’s Sleeping Room for seven months this winter. We have provided four meals so far. Check the dates for the next three months on the *Joining God in the Neighborhood* bulletin board in the main-level hallway. You can also contact  Patti Warner if you could provide a meal. The group of men who will be consuming the meal can be as small as 4–5 or as large as 15. This is one way to help people with food insecurities. It is also an outreach from First Baptist Church. The men have been super thankful.
