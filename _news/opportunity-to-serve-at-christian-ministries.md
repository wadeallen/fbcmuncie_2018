We have agreed to provide one meal a month for the menâ€™s Sleeping Room for 7 months this winter. We have now provided 4 meals so far. Check the dates for the next 3 months on the *Joining God in the Neighborhood* bulletin board on the main level hallway. You can also contact  Patti Warner if you could provide a meal. The group can be as small as 4-5 or as large as 12. This is one way to help people with food insecurities. It is also an Outreach from First Baptist Church. The men have been super thankful.
