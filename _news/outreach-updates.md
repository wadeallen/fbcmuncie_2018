Our alternative Salvation Army Bell ringing in our church was a great success. Thanks to Sue Mutter and all her bell ringers internally. We raised $779.74 which was as much as we ever raised at the mall. Thank you all who helped to make it a successful season of bell ringing.
This year for the first time in several years we had an America for Christ offering in March. Brian Green took charge and, as of this writing, $379.13 had been raised for this American Baptist Church fund. Thank you to all who participated.
This year Joe Songer organized a table for 8 at the Habitat for Humanity breakfast in March. We had several people that shared about a new home thanks to the habitat volunteers along with their own 500 sweat hours. Our church supports this local agency. Individuals are also welcome to donate to this organization.
Our donations for the YWCA women are so appreciated by the women. Please keep bringing clothing, twin sheets and blankets, and toiletries to the YWCA basket in the office. We thank you for your continued support to the women.
