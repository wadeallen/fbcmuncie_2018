title: Pastor Evaluation Underway
weight: 3

Late last year the Church Coordination Team (CCT) identified the need to conduct a performance evaluation of Pastor Wade Allen’s pastoral leadership. In many churches, this is an annual exercise to provide feedback to a pastor to compliment his strengths and make suggestions if there are areas to address. Wade has been our pastor for ten years and has not had this structured kind of feedback. Wade is looking forward to comments to affirm his work and offer suggestions about his ministry.




Moderator James Heimlich and outgoing moderator Molly Flodder are heading up a team that is being assembled to coordinate this process. In addition, they are working with Pastor Wade as he provides a self-evaluation and coordinating the distribution of a random sample survey to 15% of our active church members.

 

If you are randomly selected to participate in sharing confidential feedback about Wade’s ministry, you will receive a survey sometime this month. Only one person will know to whom the survey is sent; a different person will see the initial survey findings but not the people who submitted the responses. After that, the team will evaluate the responses and work with James and Molly to create a focused overview that will be shared with Wade. That team will also determine the highlights to share with the entire congregation.



If you have any questions or concerns about this process, please contact James Heimlich or Molly Flodder.
