A total of 77 of our active members and attendees have received by email or will be receiving by mail a survey to evaluate the leadership of Pastor Wade. This is a routine effort led by our Church Coordination Team, and Pastor Wade is looking forward to feedback to affirm his work and offer suggestions about his ministry. For those who received the survey in a random sample of the congregation, this anonymous survey must be completed and returned no later than **Sunday, March 10**.
