*By James Heimlich, Moderator*
 
In an effort to affirm the work that our pastor, Dr. Wade Allen, does in leadership of our congregation, the Church Coordination Team (CCT) determined late last year to conduct an evaluation.
 
After developing instruments for Wade to do self-evaluation and for a random sample of the congregation to evaluate similar characteristics, the exercise was rolled out in early March. A total of 34 people, 40% from the first service and 60% from the second, completed questionnaires focusing on the following work areas:  
(Spiritual Formation and Self-Care\* - Preaching and Worship Leadership\* -  Administration\* - Discipleship - Mission and Evangelism Issues - Pastoral Care - Leadership\* - Team Building and Equipping\*)




 
\*Most outstanding work areas
 
All of the responses were strongly positive, and only a small portion (15% or less) on only a few questions marked anything besides Strongly Agree and Agree to statements ranging from “Honors confidentiality” to “Models a spirit of love and a servant attitude.”
 
The open-ended questions provided the most positive and outstanding feedback of all.  Typical comments were: “Wade and his family are wonderful assets to FBC and the community.”  “We are blessed to have Pastor Wade and pray that God will see fit for him to be with us another 10 years.”  “I’m very impressed with Pastor Wade’s leadership and pastoral capabilities in our church. I look forward to his continued guidance.”
 
The CCT also asked Wade to create a short list of goals on which he would focus during the next year. He was able to strengthen and polish those goals based on information from the survey. One goal on which Wade will focus along with the CCT’s leadership is “Create a strategy for involving and equipping new people in church leadership.”
 
While the CCT hopes to conduct an evaluation every two to three years, we will continue to provide support to our pastor as he undertakes his goals each year.
 
“I appreciate the chance to be part of this process,” said Pastor Wade. “It was encouraging to be affirmed and helpful to have some constructive criticism as well.  I had not had such a thorough evaluation in my ministry and found it very helpful.  Christy and I appreciate those who worked on this project and all those who participated in providing feedback.”
 
As Moderator, my thanks go out to the team who helped create the survey and administer it. Molly Flodder helped to develop the survey instruments and to lead the process, and Roger Morency and Dan Lemen worked on formatting the survey, creating the list from which to draw the random sample, and distributing the survey instrument. The other members of the work team included Jared Bishop, Ray Conley, Bob Hartley, Penny Morris, Wilma Neal, and Gayle Songer.
