This year, First Baptist Muncie celebrates 90 years in our building and 160 years as a congregation. Wow! God has given us to each other as a gift: a people to proclaim His name and join others in bringing His kingdom life to bear on the greater Muncie community.  
It's been quite a while since we've taken a group picture of our congregation, and this year is a good time for us to do that. Michelle Heimlich, FBC member and owner of Maganda Photos, has volunteered to take our group picture. The photo will be reproduced in our Story Project book (hopefully published in December), and will also be available to be hung in our church or added to our archives. 
We plan to take this picture on **Sunday, September 15**, at **noon**. Whether you are a member or only attend occasionally, we'd like to make sure you are included! Please plan to be at church and to pick up your children from Sunday school or child care rooms as soon as the second service ends. If the weather is dry, the photo will be taken outside at the front entrance to the church building, and chairs will be provided for those who are unable to stand for very long. (Please do not park in front of the building on this date.) If we have rain, we'll take the photo in the church sanctuary instead.
Questions? We would love to make sure you have the information you need. Just see Julie Davis, Michelle Heimlich, or Wade Allen.
