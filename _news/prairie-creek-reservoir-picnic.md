The FBC Children’s Team invites all children birth–5th grade to join us at Prairie Creek Reservoir (approximately five miles southeast of Muncie, south of the White River) at **11:30 AM** on **Saturday, July 20**. We will meet in the grassy area by the playground, closest to the beach. The children’s team will provide a picnic lunch, drinks, and dessert, as well as cover the cost for those who want to swim! (Bring a blanket, lawn chairs, etc. for the picnic; we won’t have a shelter house.) Let’s hope for a nice, sunny day. ;) Registration link coming in July! **We do ask that you please accompany your children during this event**.
