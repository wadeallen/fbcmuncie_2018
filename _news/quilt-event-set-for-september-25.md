Anyone interested in learning about quilts and quilt history is invited to attend a presentation and discussion led by Marilyn Goldman, a local quilt expert and member of the Indiana Quilt Registry Project, on **Tuesday, September 25, at 7:00 PM** in the Lower Auditorium. There will be opportunities for FBC attendees or their friends to tell stories about some of the quilts that are brought in. Also, as well as sharing information about quilts, Mrs. Goldman will assess quilts that people bring in by talking about their fabric, pattern, quilting, and general value.
“This event is something Adult Ministries has planned to offer opportunities for people to meet together and develop deeper relationships within our church family,” said Julie Davis, Adult Ministries coordinator for the Church Coordination Team.
While the event itself is free, people who choose to have their quilts evaluated will be charged $5 to help offset the cost of hosting the event. Mrs. Goldman will also be selling her books. Dessert will be served.
A Quilt Event Team is pulling the details together and invites anyone who is interested in quilts (women and girls or men and boys) to attend.
A registration link will be sent out via email the week of Labor Day. Watch for it so you can sign up. There will also be opportunities to call the church office and sign up that way. **Attendance is limited to 40 people, and registration closes on Friday, September 21.**
