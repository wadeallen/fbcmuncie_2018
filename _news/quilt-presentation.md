On **Tuesday, September 25, at 7:00 PM** in the Lower Auditorium, Mrs. Marilyn Goldman, a local quilt expert, will share information about quilts, talking about their history and creation in Indiana. A few quilt owners may bring a quilt to have evaluated and, if they are willing, can share a story about the quilt they bring. The link for registration for this event was sent out last week. The team running the event has learned that some people are not waiting to make sure their registration is confirmed and, therefore, are not getting registered. Please make certain you complete the reservation and see the word COMPLETED. For those who prefer not to do computer links, there are sign up sheets in the office. Due to time constraints, a limited number of quilts can be brought for evaluation and storytelling. Therefore, requests will be honored on a first-come/first-served basis, with a cap of 40 people attending the event. **Deadline** for sign up is **Sunday, September 23**, no exceptions.
