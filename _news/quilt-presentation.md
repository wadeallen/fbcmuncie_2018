On **Tuesday, September 25, at 7 PM** in the Lower Auditorium, Mrs. Marilyn Goldman, a local quilt expert, will share information about quilts, talking about their history and creation in Indiana. In addition, a few quilt owners may bring a quilt to have evaluated and, if they are willing, can share a story about the quilt they bring. The link for registration for the event was sent out this week. For those who cannot do computer links, there are sign up sheets in the office. Due to time constraints, a limited number of quilts can be brought for evaluation and storytelling. Therefore, requests will be honored on a first-come/first-served basis, with a cap of 40 people attending the event. **Deadline** for sign up will be **Sunday, September 23**, no exceptions.
