weight: 3
---

We are grateful to all in our church family whose service, funds, and commitment to First Baptist Church sustains us and ensures us a promising future.  
 
As we learned in our Legacy celebration on November 24, we are coming to the end of the third year for which many of you made donations to the restoration, repair, and remodeling of our church. According to Dan Lemen, treasurer, the amount received toward the $300,000 pledge currently is $262,355 as of December 15. A few people extended their pledges into 2020, but many expected to complete the final payments of their pledge by the end of 2019. When you give your gifts, be sure to mark “Legacy” in the “For” line of your check.  




 


Members of the Legacy Implementation Team who are beginning to finalize some projects and begin others are Christy Allen, MaryAnne Bayer, Larry Bradburn, Mark Flodder, James Heimlich, Dan Lemen, Chad Massoth, Joe Songer, and Larry VanDeventer.
