’Tis the time for bell ringing. We are going to bring our annual support inside this year to our church. Standing outside at the mall in inclement weather when one is a senior citizen is not always smart. We have had at least two ninety-year-olds ring year after year. We usually raise around $500–$600 for the Salvation Army. We are setting a goal of $550 for this season. If you want to donate a check, please make it out to Salvation Army. We can evaluate after this season whether we can move to this new model.
