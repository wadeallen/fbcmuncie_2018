title: Salvation Army Bells Ringing
weight: 3

Everyone at the church knows we've rung bells for Salvation Army for many years. I know we all loved to ring bells until they put us outside... But you can still ring bells for the Salvation Army at the church on Sunday where its nice and warm on the inside. Please see me if you would like to ring bells at the church. Our goal this year is $1000. I know a lot of you make regular donations to the Salvation Army, so please bring them to church and drop them in. Bells will be located in the hallways downstairs and upstairs. December 15th will be the deadline to get your money in. And once again, thanks for all your help with showing the Muncie Mall that we can collect a lot more money and we don't have to stand outside in freezing cold to do it! Thanks, *Sue Lawson-Mutter*
