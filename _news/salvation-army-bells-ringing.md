FBC has been ringing Salvation Army bells at the Muncie Mall since 1991. In recent years, the mall has changed their idea where the bell ringers should be. A few years ago they moved us to the vestibule, and then to the outside of the mall. We have some ninety-year-old ringers who ring alone in inclement weather at the mall. This becomes a safety factor for our ringers. Last year, we rang in the hallways of our church so our ringers were safe and warm. Furthermore, we raised as much money as we did at the mall. We plan to do that again this year so we can continue to support the Salvation Army while providing a safe environment for our ringers.
