FBC has been ringing SA bells at the Muncie Mall since 1991. The mall has changed their idea where the bell ringers should be. A few years ago they moved us in between the doors then outside. We have some 90 year old ringers that ring alone in inclement weather at the mall. This becomes a safety and security factor for our ringers. Last year, we rang in the hallways of our church and were safe and warm. Furthermore, we raised as much money as we did at the mall. We plan to do that again this year to continue to support the Salvation Army.
