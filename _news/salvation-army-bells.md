Everyone at the church knows we used to ring bells for Salvation Army. I know we all loved to ring Bells until they put us outside.... But you can still ring bells for The Salvation Army at the church on Sunday where its nice and warm on the inside. Please see me (Sue Lawson Mutter) if you would like to ring bells at the church. Our goal this year is $1,000.00. I know a lot of you make regular donations to The Salvation Army so please bring them to church and drop them in. Bells will be located in the hallway downstairs and upstairs. Today is the deadline to get your money in. Once again, Thanks for all your help with showing the Muncie Mall that we can collect a lot more money and we don't have to stand outside in the freezing cold to do it! *Sue Lawson-Mutter*
