Also in January-April, we want to provide food to Grace Episcopal Church for their Sunday afternoon dinners.  They serve a hot meal to 85-120 people each week.  Ann Heilman, a member of our church, is one of their regular volunteers.  Situated in a small church kitchen, the group finds they can most easily open, cook and serve institutional sized cans for their side dishes.  It takes about four large cans to feed the group any particular food such as green beans, corn, mixed vegetables, etc.  We will put up a box in the church office and we need you to fill it with cans.  Bring four, if you’d like, or team up with a family member or friend to get four of the same kind of foods.  These are available at Walmart stores, Midstates Concessions on South Burlington, and  Gordon Food Service in Anderson, to name a few.  










 


Other work that is already going on will not change—Pillowcase project, Christmas Shoebox project, Hearts and Hands Back-to-School initiative, etc.  Again, the bulletin board is the place to see these and other opportunities.
