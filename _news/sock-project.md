Through the generosity of the Members of First Baptist Church, we collected 178 pairs of socks for Christian Ministries.  These socks will benefit many women, men and children that visit their sleeping rooms.  If you feel compelled to donate further, feel free to leave socks for men, women or children in the church office or donate directly to Christian Ministries located at 401 East Main Street, Muncie Indiana.   








*2 Corinthians 9:6-8 Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.  Each of you should give what what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.*   












Thank you for all of your support and efforts.
