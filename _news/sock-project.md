Through the generosity of the members of First Baptist Church, we collected 178 pairs of socks for Christian Ministries. These socks will benefit many women, men, and children who visit their sleeping rooms. If you feel compelled to donate further, feel free to leave socks for men, women, or children in the church office (marked Sock Project) or donate directly to Christian Ministries located at 401 East Main Street, Muncie, Indiana.   








Remember this: 










>*"Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver."* -- 2 Corinthians 9:6â€“8
