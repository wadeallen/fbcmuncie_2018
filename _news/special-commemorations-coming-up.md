The first Sunday in November we remember members of our church family who have passed on to be with the Lord in the last year. On the second Sunday, we recognize those who are veterans. Thank you to all who have made information available to MaryAnne Bayer and Roger Morency as they prepare for these commemorations and to both of them for helping us observe All Saintsâ€™ Day and Veterans Day.
