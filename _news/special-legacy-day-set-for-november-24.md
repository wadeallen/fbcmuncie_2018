On **Sunday November 24**, we will not only have the Harvest Dinner, but we will devote the service to commemorating First Baptist Churchâ€™s legacy.  This will provide us all an opportunity to mark the impending end of the three-year Legacy Capital Campaign and to celebrate our church building, the long-time leaders of our congregation and much wonderful work going on in our midst.  Watch the November Visitor for more details.
