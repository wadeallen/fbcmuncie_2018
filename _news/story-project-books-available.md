*by Julie Davis*
First Baptist launched the Story Project in January of this year. It's now December, so we've been working on it for an entire year! Thanks to each of you who wrote or otherwise shared your stories, we will soon have a book, *We Are the Clay*, in our hands. You had an opportunity to preorder that book on Sunday, November 24 and will have another preorder opportunity on Sunday, December 1. Those copies will be available for you to pick up here at church in the near future. (We will let you know the date as soon as we know!) Beyond that, once the book is up on Amazon, anyone will be able to order it online and have it sent to their home.
The Story Project team hopes you'll enjoy learning more about the people around you at First Baptist. No matter how long you've been attending here, I bet you'll discover something you didn't know! If you find the book encouraging, consider buying a copy for someone you know who would benefit from reading some ways that God has been at work in others' lives. Above all, pray that this work will glorify God. When people read our stories, we want them to be able to see what a faithful and loving God we serve. He has been at work in me; He has been at work in you. And He wants to work in them, too--shaping them to be more like Christ in every way. They may be the next story God will tell!
