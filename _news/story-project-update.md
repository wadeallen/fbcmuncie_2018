title: Story Project Update

Many things have been happening with your book during the month of August! The entire manuscript was reviewed by our first-level proofreader, who is a professional with more than 30 years of experience in Christian publishing. One of the great benefits of her work is that our stories have now been read by someone who doesn't know us. Because we know each other well, our brains sometimes fill in missing context as we hear each other share experiences or feelings--without us even realizing that is happening. Getting a more objective read from an outsider allows us to determine what things won't make sense without more explanation and helps us discover where the way we've expressed ourselves is either confusing or gives an impression of us that isn't accurate.  






If the proofreader had a question about your story, you may be contacted by a Story Project team member during September to resolve those issues. **Regardless of whether there are any questions to resolve, before the end of September every person who submitted a story will receive, by US mail, a copy of that story in its final form**. Please check it over to make sure the details are correct, and contact me personally before the date mentioned in the letter that accompanies it if there is anything that needs to be changed. After the date given in the letter, the book manuscript will move forward to the interior design stage, and we will not make changes after that time.  








Lots of great stories are just around the corner! Here are a couple you can look forward to reading:  






>A young family writes about their friendship with an older couple of the church who played a role in their journey toward church membership, the baptism of their older daughter, and their involvement in the church’s ministries. They said of their friends, “They have been such a blessing and inspiration to our family. Our lives, as well as our spiritual journey, have been transformed by their loving guidance and inspiring hearts.”  












 
>As a young seventh grader, this member was involved in a terrible car accident that would likely have been fatal had there been different circumstances. She reports that this accident, the prayers of others, and one switch in plans relating to the car they were driving helped her to know that God is real.
