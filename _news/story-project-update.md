title: Story Project Update

Thanks to all of you who submitted stories for the Story Project! Since I'm not talking with you about the project regularly, you might think there's not much going on. Nothing could be further from the truth! Many of the people who submitted stories have been looking through the edits on their stories and answering clarifying questions. Some Story Project team members have been meeting with people one-on-one to help them process edits. Others have been processing release forms, collecting information for bios, or scheduling appointments for pictures to be taken. There's a lot going on behind the scenes!
Between now and November, I'll be giving you a brief update each month in the Visitor so you know what your team is doing behind the scenes to bring the project to completion in December. We know you'll be excited to see the book that you--the people of First Baptist Muncie--have written! Please continue to pray for the team and for the process of telling your story of God at work.






Here are a few stories that will be included in the project:  








A member recounts the lifelong journey of her father’s struggle to find a personal relationship with Christ and the delay in his repentance until the last days of his life.  Friendship and encouragement from her wonderful Christian friend, Dad asking Jesus into his heart, and God’s promise to both women with a sign from heaven made this writer know that God keeps his promises.
 
 
This member shared about a head injury he received as a young child playing out in the yard: “Looking back on this event in my life, I believe that I had died that day.  I don’t know for how long I had stopped breathing. . .but God miraculously brought me back to life.”  His recounting of all that happened that day and in the next few years led to God giving him his true name, the one that matched who he was.
