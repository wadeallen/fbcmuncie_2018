The Story Project Team is in the home stretch to produce the book you've written, and we hope to be crossing the finish line soon! The interior of the book has been designed, and those designed pages are in the hands of two people who are doing the final proofreading. They'll be hoping to catch any remaining typos and any errors with the pagination or headings that may have been introduced during the design phase. In addition, the project team met at the end of October to discuss ways to make those in our community and denomination aware of this special work that First Baptist Muncie has undertaken.  
In just a few weeks you should be receiving definite information about how to get a copy of this book into your hands. Meanwhile, here are two more stories you can look forward to reading:
