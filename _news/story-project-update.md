title: Story Project Update

Thanks to all of you who submitted stories for the Story Project! Since I'm not talking with you about the project regularly, you might think there's not much going on. Nothing could be further from the truth! Many of the people who submitted stories have been looking through the edits on their stories and answering clarifying questions. Some Story Project team members have been meeting with people one-on-one to help them process edits. Others have been processing release forms, collecting information for bios, or scheduling appointments for pictures to be taken. There's a lot going on behind the scenes!
Between now and November, I'll be giving you a brief update each month in the Visitor so you know what your team is doing behind the scenes to bring the project to completion in December. We know you'll be excited to see the book that you--the people of First Baptist Muncie--have written! Please continue to pray for the team and for the process of telling your story of God at work.
