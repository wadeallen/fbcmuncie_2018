The Story Project team continues to work hard to produce the book you've written! If you wrote a story, by now you should have received a copy of that story in the mail with instructions to contact me personally **no later than October 13** if you need any changes made to your submission. After that date the interior design of the book will begin and we will not make further changes to the text.  
The design of our book cover has now been finalized, and I think you're going to love it! I'm excited to see more and more of the publication details fall into place. Thank you for investing your time and energy into helping First Baptist tell stories that others need to hear. Here are a couple more you can look forward to reading:  












>One member of the FBC family recounts the wonderful story of Godâ€™s healing power in her life. Her healing process from cancer surgery did not go as it was supposed to. However, God was watching over her and guiding the doctors and nurses who struggled to help her get well.  
 
>A woman who has been a member of the First Baptist family for only a couple of years was called to be the mother of many. She and her husband entered foster care hoping to find a child they might adopt and made an impact on the lives of more than 50 children who came into their home.
