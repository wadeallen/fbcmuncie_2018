Are you looking for a good way to connect with other adults on Sunday mornings? James Heimlich leads a great Sunday School class during the first-service hour! This group, which meets in the Bride's Room, includes adults of all ages and has a welcoming discussion format. If you attend second service, take a Sunday or two to come earlier and try it out.
