Fall is right around the corner, and we are having a Trunk or Treat night at the church on **Saturday, October 27** from **5:30–6:30 PM**! We need several people to volunteer their "trunks" for this event. Vehicle participants should decorate their car trunks and pass out candy to the kids. Participants can decorate their cars according to a theme and even wear a costume that goes with it! Pinterest is full of theme ideas! In order for the families of small kids to enjoy this event, we’re asking for several people (youth are welcome to help too!) to volunteer their car for the evening. In case of inclement weather, we will bring the trick-or-treating inside the church. Please see Britney Sue or anyone on the children’s team if you’re interested in being a vehicle participant. This will be an exciting evening for the kids and participants! Thanks!
