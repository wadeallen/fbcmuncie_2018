**June 9 (Lunch at Barking Cow & Scavenger Hunt Downtown 12:00–3:00 PM** – Meet in the church office at 12:00 PM. We will walk to the Barking Cow and have lunch. Youth will need to bring enough money to cover their lunch.  We will then walk around downtown Muncie, staying within certain bounds and with an adult for each group, to follow clues in a Scavenger Hunt. The last clue will lead us to a special place where we will remain for awhile. We will then walk back to the church. Please pick up your youth at First Baptist at 2:30 PM. We will need several adults, so please let Christy know if you are able to join.




If you have questions please contact  Christy Allen or Deena Green.
