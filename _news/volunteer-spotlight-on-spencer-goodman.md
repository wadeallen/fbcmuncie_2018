Have you had the opportunity to meet Spencer yet? You may not even be aware that we have a new volunteer at FBC. Spencer is volunteering with leading our Youth Sunday School Class and has been doing so for several weeks now. While living in Muncie, he found FBC through the church website and decided to come check out our church.
Spencer is originally from Marion, Indiana. His father is a physical therapist assistant in Upland, Indiana and his mother is the Dean of Nursing at Ivy Tech in Marion. Spencer also has a brother who is attending Ball State.


Spencer graduated from Ball State with a bachelor’s degree in Spanish. He is currently taking a physics class at Ball State so that he can attend dental school in the future. He has lined up interviews for dental school with IU and another in Maine later this Fall.


Spencer is currently working at Ball Memorial Hospital. Spencer’s hobbies include weightlifting, kickboxing, and reading biographies. He also enjoys watching tv and discussing politics and philosophy with his best friend and roommate.


Spencer feels that working the youth is “awesome”. He goes on to say that he enjoys “being able to come to First Baptist every week and get to know how each of my kids are doing.” He believes that he has been called to be a leader and that he can, “lead the kids in thought, discussion and theological inquiry.” Spencer believes that, “we all benefit from learning more of what the Bible can teach, and … having a solid foundation in the Bible will provide many of the morals that people need in order to be a successful, kind and driven individual.” He greatly desires to be a strong mentor to the youth at FBC.
