The children's team is in need of volunteers to help with Sunday School this summer.  We have teachers lined up, but still need "helpers" during first service during the month of July. Helpers will provide child care for ages pre-K through 2nd grade (there will be no lesson during this time!).  Please see Britney Sue or Colleen Massoth if  you're interested in helping out this summer! Thank you!
