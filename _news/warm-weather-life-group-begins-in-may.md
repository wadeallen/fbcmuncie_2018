A total of 14 members of the FBC family met last spring, summer, and early fall in an adult life group.  Half of this group is made up of people who winter in warmer places.  Most of the meetings were held in homes and the focus was on individual topics.
 


“Several of the people in our group are retired and still traveling a lot,” said Joe Songer, a group leader.  “It made sense for us not to do a study that encompassed the whole time period such as a book study of a book in the Bible or a book by a Christian author.”


 
This year, the group will do the same separate study focus so that people don’t have to not participate if they can’t be at every session.   One presentation already established will be a visit from Rev. Bob Ball of Blood ‘n Fire Ministries, who has done disaster relief work over the years with his grill “Holy Smokes.”  Rev. Bob has provide food and relief at Hurricane Katrina, for instance, and many other locations, and will talk about how Christians can help with this kind of relief.
 


The group will meet on the second and fourth Thursday evenings for study, discussion and dessert, beginning with a kickoff session to be announced for a weeknight in May.  If you have interest in being part of this group, contact Joe or Gayle Songer  .
