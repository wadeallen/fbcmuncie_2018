From June through October, a group of people, several of whom are "snowbirds" and only here in the summer, meet as part of FBC’s life groups. The group will be meeting on the second and fourth Thursday evenings of the month for dessert, program, and discussion.
 
"We do not study a book or section of the Bible as many in this group travel a great deal and cannot make every meeting or keep up with a continuing study," said Joe Songer, a leader of the group. "We try to bring in Christians from inside and outside our church or community resource people and discuss all kinds of issues. It has been a real learning experience for all of us and a chance to grow closer to each other."
 
On **Thursday evening, May 30, at 6:00 PM** the group will meet at the Flodders’ home for a cookout and to plan for the season and decide details about the programming for the sessions. New people are invited to join this planning meeting but need not decide about membership until afterwards. See Joe Songer or Molly Flodder if you have questions or are considering visiting with the group on May 30.
