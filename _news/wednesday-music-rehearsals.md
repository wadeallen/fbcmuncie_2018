The first adult choir rehearsal for the new season will be **Wednesday, September 4, 7:30-8:45 PM** in the choir room on the second floor. We need new members, as it turns out, in all sections! We did well last year. Please help us continue! If interested, please contact Bruce McFarland or just come on the 4th.
