I have really enjoyed reading the stories that have already been submitted to The Story Project! I love the variety we’re getting—no two people have the same story to tell. People are relating all different types of experiences and are speaking of many distinctive ways that God has been at work through circumstances, people, Scripture, and the voice of His Spirit speaking to our spirits. Some of the stories are about “big” things and some are about everyday things. We are unique, and that is fully reflected through the stories we have to tell.
If you haven’t yet submitted your story, there’s still time: **the deadline for story submission is April 30**. Please remember **the team is here to help**:
- You can submit your story digitally to  [thestoryproject@fbcmuncie.org](mailto:thestoryproject@fbcmuncie.org) OR  on paper in the church office.
- If you’d like one of our team members to help you get started or to give you feedback as you’re writing, we’ll pair you up with someone.
- If you don’t feel able to write your story—for whatever reason—one of our story collectors will meet with you and record you telling it. It will then be transcribed.
Your story is important—and only you can tell it. When you choose to do that, God gets glory for His work in your life, and other people have the chance to learn and draw courage from your experiences. Maybe what you have to share today will give me hope that God is with me in what I face tomorrow. Don’t take a pass on this opportunity. Ask for help if you need it, but don’t just be a story keeper: be a storyTELLER.
