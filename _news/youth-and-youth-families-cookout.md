All youth and their families are invited to the Davises’ home (1032 Walnut Creek Lane, Gas City) for a time of food and games. This is a time of relationship building for our youth, as well as for parents of youth. Please join us **today**, from **12:45–2:45 PM**. If you, as the parent/s, are unable to attend, but your youth is available, we will be happy to give them a ride!
