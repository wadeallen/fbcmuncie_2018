Believing that unity is such an important aspect for our Youth we have planned some great summer activities.  If you have any questions please contact  Christy Allen or Deena Green.






## May 19 (Mounds State Park Anderson, IN 12-4 PM)






Youth will bring a sack lunch to Church (if refrigeration is needed please place lunches in the kitchen refrigerators downstairs, we will provide a cooler for transport to Mounds). Drinks will be provided. We leave the church at 12:00.  Meet in the Church office. We will return to the church at 4:00.  You can pick up your youth at First Baptist. Parents are welcome to attend.  If you are attending and have an extra spot in your vehicle to help transport other youth, please let Christy know. We will picnic, hike, play kickball, frisbee, etc






## June 9 (Lunch at Barking Cow & Scavenger Hunt Downtown 12-3 PM)






Meet in the Church office at 12:00. We will walk to the Barking Cow and have lunch.  Youth will need to bring enough money to cover their lunch. We will then walk around downtown Muncie, staying within certain bounds and each group having an adult, to follow clues in a Scavenger Hunt.  The last clue will lead us to a special place where we will remain for a while.  We will then walk back to the Church. Pick up your youth at First Baptist at 3 PM. We will need several adults, so please let Christy know if you are able to join.






## July 14 (Hold this date)
