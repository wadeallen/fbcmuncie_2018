title: Youth Teachers Needed
weight: 3
---

We are in need of Sunday school teachers for the youth class during the 9:15 AM hour. There is a curriculum available to provide a template for the lesson, or you are welcome to create your own lesson. We are hoping to find someone to teach this class regularly, but in the interim, we are asking for volunteers. All volunteers will need to have a background check to work with minors. We are also needing people to host the youth in their homes on the third Sunday evening of each month for dinner and a group activity. Hosts will not need to provide a lesson, just to open their home and provide food. We have a great group of youth, and it's really important we continue providing this ministry to them.  
 
Please contact Christy Allen or Deena Green if you are interested in being a part of this ministry.  Also, for the most current information regarding the youth schedule, please see the  [youth page](https://fbcmuncie.org/youth) on the church website.
