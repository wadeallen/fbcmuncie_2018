Dr. Shiell has published five books, primarily in New Testament. His pioneering work on the book of Acts combines the best of New Testament rhetoric. ancient Greek and Roman art, and oral interpretation for the church. His research interests are in the areas of the oral interpretation of scripture and the interaction of audiences with the speaker. He continues to research and write in the area of Performance Criticism as a member of the Society of Biblical Literature. His new book on Acts is a volume in a sermon-based commentary series called Preaching the Word.

Billâ€™s love of scripture can be seen whenever he preaches. He is widely known for his public readings of scripture from memory and has performed the Gospel of Mark in its entirety from memory.

An avid runner, Bill enjoys timing his boys when they swim competitively and occasionally has time for a round of golf. Bill loves Christ, his family, and the church.
