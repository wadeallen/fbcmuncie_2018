With Christmas less than one week away, we are preparing for two special worship services this weekend. We will meet on Christmas Eve at 7:00 p.m. to celebrate the coming of Jesus in a candlelight atmosphere. We will consider Isaiah 9. We celebrate the fact that God broke into darkness; He came as light into the world to redeem us. This shattering of darkness took the form of a child, a son. As we gather on Christmas Eve, we celebrate this child as the one who fulfills the words of Isaiah, the promises of God from ages past.

On Christmas morning, we will consider the Christmas story as recorded in Luke 2. Jesus' birth was not a snow filled, hot chocolate laced occasion. It was messy, dirty, smelly; we will remind ourselves of the story that we have heard a million times. As we celebrate Christmas, we will remember that Christmas was a pretty scary occasion for those in Luke 2. Yet the angel’s words, “do not be afraid” assure us that God was and is up to something incredible.

I know that holidays can be busy. Many are traveling, others are spending concentrated time with family. Yet, I encourage you to carve out time to worship. Join us as we remember the true meaning of Christmas this weekend.

For those of you traveling out of town, we wish you a merry and Jesus-centered Christmas. For everyone else, I will see you this weekend.
