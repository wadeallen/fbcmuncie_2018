I have enjoyed the first two weeks of our mission statement series. It has been fun to explore the fundamental reasons that we exist. As we prepare for our third week in this series, we consider the third action word, "empower." If you look up this word in the dictionary you will find that it is defined,

>to give somebody a greater sense of confidence or self-esteem

Is this what we mean when we speak of the need to empower one another in the church? Are we simply trying to bolster individual confidence in matters of faith? I am not sure that this definition offers an accurate picture of what was intended  in our mission statement.

The sort of empowering that we are talking about has to do with equipping believers to walk with Christ. A better definition might include the words "equipping, preparing, or training." You might even consider using the word "disciple." As Jesus ascended into heaven he commanded believers,

>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19 NIV) 

So when we are talking about empowering, we are talking about discipleship. But what does this look like? How does it play out in the life of the church? On Sunday, we will consider how we empower one another to be all that God wants us to be. It is more than what we have often termed "Christian education." It is more than learning and passing on a curriculum. It is about sharing life together. Join us on Sunday as we explore the third action verb of our mission statement.
