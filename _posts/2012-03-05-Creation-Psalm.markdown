It has been fun studying the Psalms for the past couple of weeks. It is amazing that we can join with God-followers that lived thousands of years ago in confessing God's faithfulness to His people. This week, we come to Psalm 19. We're going to be joined by the Taylor Sounds, a few singers from Taylor University including our own Audrey Boyers. The service will consist of Scripture reading, preaching, singing as we engage Scripture.

In Psalm 19, David reflects on the majesty of God's creation. While David did not understand all that modern science teaches us about nature, he marvels at the intricacies of our world. Our busy lives distract us from being astonished by the world around us. Yet David understands that the creation points us to the Creator.

On Sunday, we will explore the poetry of Psalm 19 together. We will sing, collectively read and reflect on these ancient words. I hope you are able to join us.
