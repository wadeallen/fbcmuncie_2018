We live in a world of excuses. Certainly inappropriate behavior often begins with abuse or inadequacies in care. Yet we sometimes fail to claim responsibility for our conduct. We have nearly erased the word *sin* from our vocabularies. This week, we examine Psalm 51; David wrote this psalm following his indiscretion with Bathsheba. The language of the psalm informs our understanding of sin and repentance. 

David was a political leader; he was King. It is not uncommon for such leaders to engage in abuses of power, sexual escapades or corruption. Some may conclude that this is normal behavior; it just goes with the job. Yet David does not excuse his behavior. He takes full responsibility for his actions; he begs God to restore relationship with His broken servant. He admits his failure. We find the word sin used 7 times in just 19 verses. David openly admits his atrocity.

>(Psalms 51:3 NIV) For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me

And while we know that his offense affected many people, particularly Bathsheba, her husband and her child, David is most concerned with his failure to follow God's leading.

>(Psalms 51:4 NIV) Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight

We have much to learn about true repentance. Our culture makes this concept challenging; it requires us to face our behavior head on. Join us on Sunday as we explore David's response to God in Psalm 51.
