In just a few weeks, we will be transitioning to a new Sunday morning schedule. This is no small change for a congregation. However, we are excited about new opportunities as a result of this shift. I wanted to let you all know about a couple of changes regarding Sunday school. First of all, we are looking forward to increased time given to Sunday school in the new schedule. Classes should now have a full hour to fellowship, pray and study. The schedule looks like this:

9:15 am - 10:15 am - Early Worship/Early Sunday School
10:15 am - 10:45 am - Fellowship time in the Lower Auditorium
10:45 am - 11:45 am - Late Worship/Late Sunday School  

###Early Hour

Early Worship (traditional style) will take place in the sanctuary during the early hour. Youth and Children Sunday school will also meet during the early hour. Also, two intergenerational adult classes will meet during this time. These classes will function in two-month blocks. In other words, every two months the teachers and/or topics may shift. One of the classes will be primarily topic based. The teacher will deal with current issues relating them to Scripture. The second class will be Scripture based and will initially follow the sermon schedule. 

The topical class will be taught by Doug Gregg through the end of June. This class will meet in the church lounge. They will be studying a book by Tony Campolo entitled *20 Hot Potatoes Christians are Afraid to Touch*. The Scripture based class will be taught by Tim Stigers and Jim Butler and will meet in the lower auditorium. Since the sermons will be in Genesis following Easter, this class will also be in Genesis.  

###Fellowship Time

One of the benefits of the new schedule will be an increased opportunity for fellowship. In our current schedule, everyone is rushing around to make it to Sunday school on time. The new schedule will grant a full 30 minutes to spend time talking with people who possibly attend another service. I hope that everyone will take advantage of this occasion.

###Late Hour

Late Worship (contemporary style) will take place in the sanctuary during the late hour. A chief problem with our current schedule was Sunday school classes running into the late hour. Many times late worship will begin with only half of the people in attendance during the opening song. The earlier start time will also allow students to make it back to campus for lunch. During this hour the Bykota, Two by Two and Friendship classes will meet along with a new intergenerational class. The intergenerational class will be a discussion based class that operates on two month blocks. In other words, every two months the teachers and/or topics may shift. The first block will begin April 15 and go through June. Bill Eidson, Susan Londt, Allen Shelton and others will rotate teaching this class.

Change sometimes brings fear. We aren't always sure how everything will work out. I would encourage you to anticipate the positive in the new schedule. Let's continue to explore, listen and be flexible as we make this transition as a church family. As Paul writes to the church at Philippi,

>Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others. Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus (Philippians 2:4–5 NIV)

Please feel free to contact me or any church council member with questions about the new schedule.
