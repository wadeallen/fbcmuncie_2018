In Genesis 49, Jacob calls his sons to his deathbed for a blessing. He speaks powerful words that shape generations to come. His sons, forming the twelve tribes of Israel, will prepare the way for God to enter the world through Jesus. As the book of Genesis nears its end, we are reminded that the story continues as the people of God are now formed.
