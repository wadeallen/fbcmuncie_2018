In the closing scenes of Genesis, we are reminded that God’s story is not over. As Jacob and Joseph pass from the scene, the promise of deliverance looms. As the curtain closes in Genesis, Joseph is embalmed and lies in an Egyptian coffin. Yet the story of God continues. As we gather, we are reminded of our connection with this story. We are reminded that God’s grace comes to fruition through the work of Jesus. As we connect and live in story of God, we are transformed.
