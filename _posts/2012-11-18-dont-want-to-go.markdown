On November 18, we will worship in a combined worship service at 1045 a.m. The children will share a musical about the story of Jonah. We will also reflect the sermon on the call of God in our own lives. Jonah was more concerned about his own comfort, less concerned about following God’s mission in the world. We are challenged by his story to discard our own plans for God’s mission.
