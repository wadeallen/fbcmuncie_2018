I’ve noticed a trend. After recently donning some new leadership and
life roles, many good-natured folks have inquired about what I’ve done
with my life lately (besides create the illusion of a perpetual chaotic
furor). What you’re reading is one attempt towards bucking this trend.

I believe good leaders tell stories. While I don’t have the strongest
track record for consistent updates on
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/MatthewPaulHeadley) or
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/mattheadley), I’m planning to regularly
carve out time to tell stories here of what God is up to in my life and
ministry. Here goes.

Four big things began in my life between July and October of 2012.

-   July: Youth Ministry. I was called to join the staff a parachurch
    organization called Muncie Area Youth for Christ
    [(YFC)](http://www.yfc.net/) as the coordinator for a [“Campus
    Life”](http://www.facebook.com/MuncieCentralCampusLife) ministry in
    the Muncie Central High School community.
-   August: Church Leadership. After three years of serving [First
    Baptist Church of Muncie](http://fbcmuncie.org) as a worship arts
    director, I was called to serve as an associate pastor, broadening
    my previous leadership role to include outreach ministry.
-   September: Parenthood. My wife and I met Hannah Joy, an amazing new person who is also our first child. Three words: Beautiful. Scary.
    Hilarious.
-   October: Education. For the grand finale of my journey through an
    M.Div. with [Northern Seminary](http://www.seminary.edu/), I began a
    chaplaincy internship with the gifted staff in the spiritual care
    department at Ball Memorial Hospital.

These new commitments have presented me with some exciting and
formidable challenges. I’ve been humbled by the patience and grace
friends around me have extended as I work to balance these commitments
out. I hope that, as I tell my story and how God is working through it,
you will see him moving in your own life, in our community, and maybe
even the world. Peace!
