As we approach Christmas day, we are often overwhelmed with the stress of the holiday season. The hustle and bustle of buying gifts and preparing food often overshadow the true meaning of Christmas. On this third Sunday of Advent, we consider Mary's response to God's intervention in her life. It is a response of giving. May we be challenged through this story to submit our lives to God's purposes. Luke 1:39-55
