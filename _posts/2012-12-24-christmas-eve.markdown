The candlelight Christmas Eve service at First Baptist Church Muncie is a highlight of the Christmas season. Families gather to kick off Christmas celebrations in a beautifully decorated sanctuary. As we light Christmas eve candle, we remember the reason for our celebration. The story of Christmas is placed in the context of Christ's sacrifice for us. There is no more appropriate way to begin Christmas than by receiving the most precious gift, His body broken for us and His blood shed for us.
