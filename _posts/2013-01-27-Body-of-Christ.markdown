Paul uses the illustration of anatomy to describe the way we function as a church. A physical body has many parts, but it is one unit. Each part has a vital role in is health. As we study 1 Corinthians 12:12-31a, we are each challenged to steward our time and energy in ways that strengthen the body of Christ.
