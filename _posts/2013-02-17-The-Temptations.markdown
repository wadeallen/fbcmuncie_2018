Shortly after Jesus's baptism, he travels into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. For 40 days, he eats nothing and battles temptation. As we explore Luke's account of these temptations, we are challenged in our own temptations. Jesus models for us successful resistance to the evil one. Luke 4:1-13
