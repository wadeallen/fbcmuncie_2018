The story of Mary pouring perfume on Jesus' feet during an evening banquet is a model for us. Out of all the people in the room that evening, Mary was most in tune with what God was doing in the world. While her action draws criticism, her extravagant gift honors Jesus. Jesus commends her for her sacrifice. As we study this passage together, we will reflect on our own willingness to serve in this posture. John 12:1-8
