The story of Easter is familiar. Women going to the tomb, angels appearing and disciples running to tell others. But as we survey the gospel accounts of Jesus' resurrection, we discover the pivotal nature of this event. For Jesus' followers, Easter changed everything. May it change everything for us too. John 20:1-18
