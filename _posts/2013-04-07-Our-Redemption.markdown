Paul reminds us why we worship. Our worship is centered in God's work redemption through the blood of Jesus. We are reminded that we have been called, chosen to be a part of God's work. We are reminded that God's plan of redemption began before the dawn of time. He includes us, seals us and puts a deposit down on us as his children. Such truth is at the center of our worship. Ephesians 1:3-13
