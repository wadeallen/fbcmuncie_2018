Paul describes the work of God in us. We were dead, useless; God resuscitated, raised us to new life in Christ. He continues to form us into his image. Paul describes us as God's workmanship. Isaiah describes us as clay in the hands of the Potter. May we acknowledge our role as one of dependence and reliance. Ephesians 2:1-10
