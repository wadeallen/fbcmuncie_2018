Paul remind us that we were want separated from God, excluded from the family. Yet through the blood of Jesus, we are invited as members of God's household. In Ephesians 2:11-22, Paul urges us toward unity. He uses a variety of images to prompt us toward reconcilation so that we can become God's dwelling on earth.
