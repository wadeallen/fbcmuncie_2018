In prison, Paul relates to the churches in Asia minor his purpose in life. He has been called by God to unveil a mystery. This mystery has been unknown to previous generations. Now, God has revealed His plan through the work of His Son, Jesus. And because of this work, we now have confident access to Him. Ephesians 3:1-12
