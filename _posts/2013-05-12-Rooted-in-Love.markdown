On Mother's Day, we will be studying Ephesians 3:14-21. As Paul prays for the church, he desires that they be rooted in the love of God. While God's love is incomprehensible, we can experience it. And as it makes it way into our hearts, we are filled with unimaginable power that can transform our world.
