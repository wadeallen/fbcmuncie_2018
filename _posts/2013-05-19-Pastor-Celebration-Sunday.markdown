In June 2012, Wade graduated from Northern Seminary with the Doctor of Ministry degree. In September 2013, Wade will celebrate his 20th anniversary of ordination. On this special Sunday, we celebrate Pentecost as well as our pastor. Alistair Brown, President of Northern Seminary, will be preaching in worship.
