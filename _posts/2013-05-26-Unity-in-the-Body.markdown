In Ephesians 4, Paul shifts his tone to instruction. The first three chapters, Paul has described God working throughout all of history. He explained how God included you and me in his plan (redeemed us, rescued us, unveiled the mystery of His salvation plan). In Ephesians 4:1-6, Paul urges us to Live lives worthy of this calling. He admonishes us toward unity and peace in light of God's grace toward us.
