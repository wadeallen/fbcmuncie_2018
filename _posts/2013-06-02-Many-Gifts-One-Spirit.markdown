While Paul has highlighted the importance of unity, he also understands that a variety of expressed gifts are necessary. In Ephesians 4:7-12, Paul clarifies the building of God's people. God distributes gifts to his people to strengthen the church. The purpose of all church leaders (both paid and volunteer) is to equip the people to do the ministry of the church.
