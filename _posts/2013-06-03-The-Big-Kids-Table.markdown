Do you remember the little kids table? At family gatherings, we always had an adult table and a little kids table. There were always a few awkward years when you had to remain at the little kids table. I don't know if it was a matter of chair distribution or helping younger siblings feel included. Either way, we all like to graduate up. Elementary years are the worst. You're a bit too old for the little kid toys (although you may still like them), but you are not yet ready for the big kid toys. We finally navigate to a stable place. We grow up.

Growing up is a natural part of life. It seems strange when we stagnate. Breast feeding four-year olds or bottle carrying six year olds cause us to wonder if parents are doing their job. Why aren't they moving on? Why aren't they growing up?

In this week's text, Paul pictures a mature church. He describes the dangers of remaining in spiritual childhood. An infant church is vulnerable, blown by the winds of false teachers. It is a dangerous place to be. Yet Paul pictures the church at Ephesus as grown up. He describes,

>(Ephesians 4:16 NIV) From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.

It is natural to physically grow. At the same time, it is normal to grow spiritually. In fact, something is wrong if this does not happen. And when we are mature, every part of the body works together. It functions in a healthy way. As we consider this text on Sunday, may we be challenged to grow up. May we be dissatisfied to remain as spiritual infants, longing to sit at the big kids table.
