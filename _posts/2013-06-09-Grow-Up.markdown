Paul desires growth for the church at Ephesus. He compares the church with an anatomical body. While we all begin as infants, we grow through childhood, into adolescence toward adulthood. It is only natural that we would reach maturity. He expects the same for the church. As the church develops, he imagines them developing into the fully functioning body of Christ. Ephesians 4:13–16
