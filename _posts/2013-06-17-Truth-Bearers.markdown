This week in worship, we talked about wearing new clothes. We are not talking about the latest fashion trends or the need to recreate our wardrobe. We are discussing the spiritual clothing of God-followers. Paul instructs us (in his letter to the Ephesians),

>(Ephesians 4:22–24 NIV) to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. 

So what does this look like? What sorts of spiritual threads are we to wear? Over the next several weeks, we are going to specifically examine the fabric of our clothing. This week, we will be looking at one verse. 

>(Ephesians 4:25 NIV) Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body. 

Seems pretty fundamental, doesn't it? Isn't this one of the ten commandments (the main rules)? We also read in a number of places of God as truth. We read in the Old Testament,

>(Numbers 23:19 NIV) God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind.

And the author of Hebrews reminds us,

>(Hebrews 6:18 NIV) it is impossible for God to lie

No doubt as children of God, we are to model truth. Yet we live in a world that often confuses truth and falsehood. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish the two. We (Christians) occasionally muddy the waters. We are not always honest with each other, sporadically choosing diplomatic tones over truth. Join us on Sunday as we explore the multi-faceted nature of truth telling. We are called by God to proclaim truth in every dimension of life.
