Paul wants us to put on the new clothes that God made for us. While there is a place for anger in the Christian life, it must be kept in check. Anger can quickly degenerate into sin and act as an inroad for the devilâ€™s destructive work.  May we continually check our motivations for anger and repent of the tendency put on old clothes.
