As Paul continues to explain what life in Christ looks like, he focuses on the words of our mouth. We are encouraged to be careful about what we say. Our words have tremendous power. They can hurt or heal, damage or build up. Our new clothes include careful consideration about what we say. Ephesians 4:29-30
