As Paul continues to describe the new clothes of the Christians, he touches on a topic that is often taken lightly in our culture. We flippantly dismiss obsenity as harmless or innocent. Paul calls Christians to the high standard of purity in contrast to obscenity. As Peter reminds us, we are called to be a holy people in the same way that God is holy. Sometimes the standard seems impossibly high. Yet Paul reminds us that even the slightest hint of impurity is dangerous. Ephesians 5:3-4
