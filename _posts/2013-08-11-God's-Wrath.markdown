We have been encouraged to wear new clothes in Christ. We been told to put off the old, put on the new. However, it is often difficult when the ways of God are in contrast to the ways of the world. Paul warns us to take this admonition seriously. In fact, those who continue to live in immorality, impurity, greed will not inherit the kingdom of God. We are warned of God's wrath for those who continue in ways contrary to his nature. Ephesians 5:5-7
