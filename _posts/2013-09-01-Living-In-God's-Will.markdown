In Paul's letter to the Ephesians, he insists that their lives be different. He wants them to be careful, to pay attention to how they live, literally how they walk. In Ephesians 5:15-21, Paul highlights the need to be attentive the movement of the Spirit in all we do. He also describes the essential dynamic of living in community with one another. As we study this passage, may we learn to live as God desires.
