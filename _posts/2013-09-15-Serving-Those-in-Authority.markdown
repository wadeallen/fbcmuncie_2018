Paul's practical application of his admonition "be careful how you live" plays itself out in our relationships. Last week, we talked about the relationship of the husband and a wife. This week, we talk about parents and children, masters and slaves. While it is difficult to appreciate authority figures in our lives, God calls us to honor, respect, even though obey them. We are to serve them as we serve Christ. Ephesians 6:1-9
