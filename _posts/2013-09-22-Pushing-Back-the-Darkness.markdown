While Paul has challenged us to be careful in how we live (particularly through our marriages and families), he now turns his attention to the battle of our daily lives. He understands each of us as under attack; he urges us to remain strong. In Ephesians 6:10-20, Paul details our plan for battle as we take on the darkness of our world.
