For the next several weeks, we will be studying the book of Ruth. In the first few verses of this book, we find tremendous suffering. For Naomi, life is not good. She suffers famine, relocation, disappointment, barrenness in her family and the death of her children. To make matters worse, she is now on the brink of poverty as a widow with no support. The story of Ruth begins in a desperate place. Ruth 1:1-5
