By no mere coincidence, Ruth finds herself gleaning in the field of Boaz, a kind and charitable relative of Naomi's family. Through their relationship with Boaz, God's provision and grace is made evident in Ruth and Naomi's lives. God has blessed us today through a relationship with his son, Jesus Christ. How may God use relationships in our lives that we may be a blessing to others? Ruth 2:1-23
