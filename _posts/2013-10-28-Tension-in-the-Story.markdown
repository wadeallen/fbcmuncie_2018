It is sometimes a challenge to find a movie that relates to our entire family. With two teenagers, two adults and an eight-year-old, coming up with something that everyone will enjoy is tough. We have to find a riveting story. Who doesn't like suspense? A good story always has tension; it is not predictable. If I am able to stay awake through the entire show, it must have an appropriate amount of tension.

The book of Ruth is a good story; and it certainly has its share of tension. As we begin chapter four this week, the story takes another twist. If you have not had a chance to be a part of each sermon, let me encourage you to catch up by watching the videos.

We left off last week with Boaz' promise to make sure that Ruth has a kinsmen-redeemer. But someone closer in relationship to the family has the legal right to redeem. 

>(Ruth 3:12 NIV) Although it is true that I am near of kin, there is a kinsman-redeemer nearer than I. 

Our heart sinks; we thought that it was all going to work out. Ruth and Boaz would ride off into the sunset, happily ever after. Things are not going as planned. What is going to happen? Are Naomi and Ruth going to end up in some other guy's home? 

Join us on Sunday as we explore the legal proceedings of Boaz and the city elders. As the tension of the story keeps up on the edge of our seat, we are assured that God is in the middle of it all. We also discover the selfless posture of Boaz as he brings the case to the elders.
