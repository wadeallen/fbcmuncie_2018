In the final scene of the story, God brings redemption to Naomi through the birth of Obed. We must be careful to not romanticize the story.The final scene reminds us that the primary message of the story is one of sacrifice, courage, redemption and rescue. As we reflect on the story, we are challenged to participate in God's plan with the same sort of selfless giving. And as we lay down our own agendas, God creates new life to redeem his people. Ruth 4:13â€“17
