We are closing in on our study of Ruth this week. After this week, we will have one more opportunity to reflect on the story. On Sunday, November 24,
we will gather in a combined service for a dramatic presentation of the story of Ruth. Be sure to bring a side dish and hang around after the service for our annual Harvest Dinner. During this time, we will share about all that God is doing among us at First Baptist. Following the Harvest Dinner, you are also invited to help decorate the church for Christmas.

Our sermon format will be a bit different this week. I will briefly discuss the concluding genealogy in the final verses. Doug and Matt will then join me on stage to walk through a few questions about Ruth. Our approach will be conversational. We hope that it will help solidify what we have learned in this study.

We often skip over genealogies in Scripture. These are the parts of the Bible that you don't want to have to read aloud in a small group. Barely pronounceable, the names mean little to us. But there is a reason for genealogies; they teach us an important truth. The story of God spans many generations. We are connected to Ruth, to David, to the prophets. Their lives and our lives are a part of God's story. 

Join us on Sunday as we explore the final genealogy in Ruth and reflect on the series. I have learned much in this study; I hope you can say the same.
