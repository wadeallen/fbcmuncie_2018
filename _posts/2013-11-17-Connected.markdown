In this final section of the book of Ruth, we are reminded that this is not an isolated story. Ruth is connected to what God has been doing since the beginning of time. She is connected to what God will eventually do through Jesus. As we study Ruth 4:18â€“22, we are reminded of our connection with the story. On this Sunday, Wade, Matt and Doug will also answer questions about the overall series.
