As we enter the season of Advent, it is a great time to form the habit of spending time in God's Word. I did a quick search last week for Advent devotionals. I found a multitude of resources, but gravitated toward a booklet designed for Advent 2013 by Fresno Pacific University. You can get the devotional [here](http://www.fresno.edu/adventdevotions). It provides a Scripture to read each day and a brief devotional thought. I hope that you will check it out.

Spending time in God's Word is crucial. In fact, in this week's text, we are reminded of this truth. Paul highlights the role of God's Word in the life of the believer.

>(Romans 15:4 NIV) For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.

He describes Scripture as leading us toward unity and providing the necessary power to face the challenges of this world. Do you struggle in your relationship with God? Do you sometimes feel that God is distant? Why don't you try spending more time in God's Word this Advent season. You may find an untapped source of strength. Join us on Sunday as we consider the vital place of God's Word in our lives.
