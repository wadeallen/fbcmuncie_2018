On this fourth Sunday of Advent, we explore the first few verses of Paul's letter to the Romans. We are reminded that we are recipients of *charis*, grace/gift. This gift is the work of God through Jesus. As we near Christmas Day, may we discover the true meaning of the greatest gift of all. Romans 1:1-7
