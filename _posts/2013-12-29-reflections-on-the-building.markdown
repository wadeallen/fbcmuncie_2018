In 2014, the building at First Baptist Church Muncie will be 85 years old. While church buildings did not become common practice until about the third century, modern expressions of the church are often indistinguishable from their buildings. The church is certainly not the building. At the same time, our building is a beautiful declaration of who we are and what we believe. Bill Eidson, retired history professor at Ball State University, will reflect on the symbolism and design of our 85 year old building.
