John the Baptist was deemed the greatest man every born by Jesus. He was faithful to God's calling to live in the desert, eat locusts and honey, preach a bold and offensive message. In fact, he would be killed for valiant message. Yet when Jesus approaches him for baptism, John's initial response was to forbid Jesus. We will explore how John's tendency continues to be our own experience. Matthew 3:13-17
