In Matthew 4:12-23 Jesus leaves his hometown to begin his ministry. His actions are decisive; there is no turning back. He invites others to join Him on His mission. They too are quick to respond. They drop everything (right in the middle of their work) to join him. As we study this text together, we are reminded of what it looks like to follow Jesus.
