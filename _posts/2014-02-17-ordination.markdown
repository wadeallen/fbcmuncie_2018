Sunday is a very special day in the life of First Baptist Church Muncie. It is a day to celebrate what God has done. At the same time, it will not be an easy day as we say goodbye (for now) to dear friends. 

As we gather for combined worship at 10:45, we will ordain Matt Headley into the Gospel ministry. We will gather for a meal following the service to bid the Headley family a warm farewell. You are invited to bring your favorite dish to share, meat and drinks will be provided.

As we worship together, we will be considering Peter's instruction to church leaders. His words remind us of the role of church leaders and the importance of their work. While Matt has been active in ministry for several years, this service marks an official commissioning for the work that he will spend his life pursuing. It is appropriate to remind him of the necessary posture of this work. Peter instructs church elders (leaders, pastors) to

>(1 Peter 5:2 NIV) Be shepherds of God’s flock that is under your care, serving as overseers

We will explore this chapter on Sunday as we send Matt forward to serve the Kingdom. I hope that everyone will be able to attend this momentous occasion.
