Have you ever wondered why Jesus performed miracles? Certainly the recipients of the miracles benefited from their encounter with Jesus. Yet if you think about it, all of the people who were healed by Jesus eventually died. Even Lazarus, who was resurrected from the tomb, died again. At best, the miracles were temporary. So why did Jesus spend time healing disease?

The miracles of Jesus reveal to us God's plan for Creation. We must be careful to not isolate the miracles, making them more about the recipients. Sure, God's grace was celebrated in each case. The once blind man, the woman healed with the issue of blood and the once demon-possessed man were set free from their suffering. But their healing was not solely for them. Jesus, through his miracles, was proving his identity. He was revealing God's restoration of Eden. 

This week, our study will be in John 11. The infamous story of the resurrection of Lazarus reveals God's heart for the suffering of this fallen world. Jesus stands at the graveside of a friend and weeps. It is easy to understand this story from our perspective. We too cry at funerals. We are saddened by the disconnect that death brings. Yet, I have a hunch that Jesus' tears reflect a deeper reality. With the Cross in view, Jesus calls a man who has been dead for four days from the tomb. In doing so, he reveals his power over sin and death. With tears streaming his face, he let the world know that he was the Christ come to redeem a fallen world. We must not read John 11 apart from Genesis 3. They are connected. 

As a result, John tells us,

>(John 11:45 NIV) Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him. 

This is why Jesus healed. His miracles were to show the world who He was and what He had come to do. Join us on Sunday as we explore the story together.
