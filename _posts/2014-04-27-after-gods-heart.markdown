As we begin a series over the life of David, we are reminded that he is described as "a man after God's own heart." We will explore the context around David's life to prepare for David's story. At the same time, we will touch on God's preference for those who authentically seek him. David's heart is one of passion and purpose. We will be challenged as we explore the story together.
