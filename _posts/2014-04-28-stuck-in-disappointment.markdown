We are moving forward in our David series. This Sunday we come to week two. We are backing up a bit as God is setting the stage for David. Last week, we considered God's rejection of Saul. While Saul has been rejected, he remains on the throne. Samuel left Saul; he will never go back to him. We find Samuel in a bout of discouragement, perhaps even depression. He knows that the reigning king no longer has the blessing of God. He fears for his and his country's security. He is not sure what is going to happen next.

Not only is Samuel grieving; God is also sorrowful. We read,

>(1 Samuel 15:35 NIV) Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him. And the LORD was grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel. 

It is in this context that God invites Samuel to join Him on His mission. God is not finished; He has a plan. God is ready to move on; Samuel seems to be stuck. God asks,

>(1 Samuel 16:1 NIV) How long will you mourn for Saul?

Many of us can relate to this place. It is easy to remain in difficult places. When doubt, disappointment and fear attack, we often find ourselves overwhelmed; we are unable to move. 

Samuel has a choice to make. He can remain at the pity party or he can join God. God gently prods the prophet to action. Samuel is hesitant; God is persistent. The next six words are powerful. Simply put,

>(1 Samuel 16:4 NIV) Samuel did what the LORD said.

We will journey with Samuel as he follows God's plan. He does not know the details; he simply knows that God is leading. He chooses to join God and finds an unlikely king tending his sheep. We may find ourselves in a similar place. God is prodding, urging us to go. We don't know where He is leading, but we know we must join Him. On Sunday, we will walk through 1 Samuel 15:34-16:13. I hope you can join us as we explore this passage together.
