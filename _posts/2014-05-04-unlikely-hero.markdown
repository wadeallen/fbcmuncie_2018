It seems that the nation of Israel is heading to destruction. The elected king has been rejected by God. The prophet Samuel is bummed out wondering what is next for this people. All the while, God is working and moving on a Judean hillside. As we study 1 Samuel 15:34-16:13 together, we find that God's plan is not always the plan that we might choose. Yet, God's choice is always for the best.
