I will celebrate my twenty-second Father's Day without my earthly father this year. As I reflect on my relationship with my dad, I am filled with gratitude. I was blessed to have a father who loved me, spent time with me, supported and taught me what it looks like to follow Jesus. While I miss him tremendously, I am thankful for him. 

We will take a break from our David series this week to talk about fatherhood. We will explore Ephesians 6:1-4 as we consider the dynamics of the parent/child relationship. For those of us who are fathers, we are challenged to carefully consider how we relate to our children. At the same time, this passage challenges each of us to live in obedience to our heavenly Father. As God's children, we model for our own children what it means to submit to the loving discipline and instruction of God. 

Join us on Sunday as we consider the dynamics of fatherhood and our appropriate response to live them out in our world today.
