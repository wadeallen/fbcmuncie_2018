As we breeze through three chapters this week, we find Saul on the hunt for David. David has to wake up each morning wondering if his life will end. Yet, David trusts God. He releases his fear and anxiety and allows God to call the shots. Even when he has a chance to take Saul out (chapter 24), he refuses to run ahead of God.
