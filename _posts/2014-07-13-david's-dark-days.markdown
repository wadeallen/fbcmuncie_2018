As we continue to walk through the story of David, we come to an extended narrative of David's life just prior to Saul's death. In desperation, David retreats to the Philistines. It appears that these years are dark days for David as God is scarcely mentioned by David in these verses. Even though David is in a dark place, God does not abandon him.
