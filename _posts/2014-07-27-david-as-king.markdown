After Saul's death, David assumes the throne. However, his initial kingdom is limited as Saul's family claims portions of the kingdom. David remains patient and confident that God will provide. In time, David's territory and prosperity expand to impressive size. As we transition from uncertainty to blessing, the road becomes fraught with danger. As we learn from David's life, comfort and security are breeding grounds for sin.
