The story of David and Bathsheba would qualify for a TV mini-series or blockbuster movie. We have all the elements; adultery, sex, misuse of power, lying, and murder litter the story. But the Bible records more than just the historical account. We have insight into David's heart during this period. Psalm 51 records his response to God after being confronted by Nathan. As we explore this text, we find characteristics of true repentance and true restoration.
