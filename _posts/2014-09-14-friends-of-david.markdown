The tragic events of 2 Samuel 14-19 include David's son, Absalom, conspiring against his own father. He leads a rebellion that will result in his death. David is distraught and torn apart by these events. Yet in the middle of these circumstances, God provides friends that help him through. Each one plays a different role as friend to David. As we reflect on David's friends, we are challenged to live in community with those around us.
