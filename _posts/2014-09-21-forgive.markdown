David's heart for God has challenged us in many ways throughout this series. Once again, we watch David as he deals with a first-class jerk. David is willing to extend grace to Shimei because he has received grace from God. In 2 Samuel 16 and 19, we witness David's interaction with Shimei. We learn what it looks like to forgive.
