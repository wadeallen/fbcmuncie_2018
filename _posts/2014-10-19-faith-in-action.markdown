James challenges faith with no action. In James 1:19-27, James describes authentic faith as manifesting itself in the way we live. On the one hand, it is about restraint from evil. On the other hand, it is about pursuing justice for the oppressed. James straight forward instruction does not allow us to rest comfortably in our pews.
