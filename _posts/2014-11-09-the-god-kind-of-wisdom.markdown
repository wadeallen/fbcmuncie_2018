James continues to address church leaders in the latter part of chapter three. He challenges them to reveal their wisdom in their works/deeds. In this short passage, James contrasts the wisdom from below with the wisdom from above. We find striking contradictions between intellect and behavior. If we want to live in God's wisdom, our lives will exhibit particular characteristics.
