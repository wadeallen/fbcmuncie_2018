In this first Sunday of the season of Advent, we explore Mark 13:24-37. Jesus let's his disciples in on how things are going to shake out at the end of time. While he assures them that they will not know when it is going to happen, he encourages them to be prepared. It will happen and they should be careful to be ready. As we prepare for Christmas (during the season of Advent), we should also prepare for the second coming of Jesus.
