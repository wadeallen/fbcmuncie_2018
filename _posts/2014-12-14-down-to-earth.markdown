The first verses of John's Gospel are mind-bending. Yet they relate to us the apostle's experience as a young man. John unpacks the inconceivable truth of God becoming flesh in our world. The Creator who existed before time dwelt among us. And his coming changed our world forever. On this third Sunday of Advent, we explore John 1:1-18.
