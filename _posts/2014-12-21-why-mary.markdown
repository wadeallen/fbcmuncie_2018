In this final Sunday of Advent, we consider the extreme faith and submission of Mary. Mary is visited by the angel Gabriel and told that her life is about to dramatically change. His news must have been disturbing and filled with uncertainty. May we be challenged to live in the same sort of all-out trust in God's movement in our lives. Luke 1:26-38
