As we come to the second sermon in our mission statement series, we explore our calling to care for one another. We open the letter of 1 John; the elder John speaks from tremendous experience to the Christians of the first century. He calls them to the remarkable task of caring, loving one another. As we love one another we complete the work of Christ and reveal to the world God's love for them.
