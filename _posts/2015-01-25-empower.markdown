In this third sermon in our mission statement series, we consider the task of empowering one another in the faith. First Baptist Church Muncie exists to equip this body of believers to walk with Jesus. We do this by engaging Scripture, sharing our stories, praying together, prompting each other in spiritual disciplines, and discerning and using our spiritual gifts.
