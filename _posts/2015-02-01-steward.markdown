In this fourth sermon in our mission statement series, we consider the concept of stewardship. Our resources are not our own, they are on loan from God. Jesus' story in Luke 16 reminds us of the necessity to think shrewdly about all that God had given us. As we employ our resources for Kingdom purposes, we are faithful servants of the master.
