As we begin the season of Lent, we are reminded of Jesus' suffering on the cross. His suffering provides salvation for us. As we explore 1 Peter 3:18-22, we are reminded of the suffering of first century Christians. Yet even in their suffering, they could rest assured of God's provision for them in Jesus' death and resurrection.
