In our first Sunday of Muncie Reach Week, we are challenged to consider all that God has given to us and then offer it back to God as worship. Paul warns us against pride and entitlement and calls us to serve as the body of Christ in our world. Romans 12:1-8 helps us re frame our understanding of what it means to live life in the Spirit of God.
