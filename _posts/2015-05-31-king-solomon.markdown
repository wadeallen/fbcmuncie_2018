As we begin our study of King Solomon, we find David busy cuddling with a young virgin. David is oblivious to the rebellion of his son, Adonijah. Nathan and Bathsheba plead with David to wake up to God's plan. David responds with action and God's king, Solomon is established on the throne. May we be attentive to God's movement as we seek His mission in our world.
