As we explore 1 Kings 2:12-46 in the context of our civilized culture, we are troubled by the amount of bloodshed. However, in the context of the ancient world, we find a mix of grace and guilt. Solomon's decisions highlight the seriousness of sin, the necessity of Christ's blood shed for us and God's second chances. We are challenged to consider our own failures in light of God's grace.
