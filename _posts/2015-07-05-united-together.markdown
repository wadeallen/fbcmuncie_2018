On July 5, we will gather in a combined worship service with two local churches. The Bridge (which usually meets at Cornerstone Center for the Arts) and The Revolution (which usually meets at the Ball State Student Center) will be joining us (at First Baptist) for a combined service at 10:45 AM. Neil Kring (from the Revolution) will be preaching and the band from the Bridge will be leading the music.
