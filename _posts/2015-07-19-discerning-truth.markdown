Solomon's wisdom is a key aspect of his story. In this week's text (1 Kings 3:16-28), we see it play out in the lives of two prostitutes. Solomon does not have the tools he needs to solve a dillema of two babies (one dead and the other stolen). He utilizes an unconventional solution that reveals the truth. In the same way, we are called to live lives of dependence on God's wisdom.
