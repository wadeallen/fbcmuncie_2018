1 Kings 4 is a description of Solomon's Administration. We find an almost idealistic view of a wise, successful, powerful, wealthy and famous king. Yet, we see hints of compromise in this description. King Solomon stands as a image of blessing and prosperity. In this text, we reflect on what it means to respond appropriately to blessing in our lives.
