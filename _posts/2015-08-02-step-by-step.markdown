We have read about David's desire to build a temple for God. We remember that God did not allow him to fulfill this desire. Rather, God promised his son as completing this endeavor. In 1 Kings 5, God prompts Solomon toward this task. Solomon takes advantage of the opportunity at hand and sets up the system of building that will produce the one of the grandest structures of his time.
