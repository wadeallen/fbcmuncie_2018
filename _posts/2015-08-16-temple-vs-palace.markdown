In 1 Kings 7, we have a description of Solomon's palace. On the surface, the text seems to describe a building with its blueprint and materials. But if we look closer at this description, we find that it reveals Solomon's heart. As we compare the temple and the palace, we see that Solomon is far more concerned with his house. These images (temple and palace) can help us evaluate how we view and understand our resources.
