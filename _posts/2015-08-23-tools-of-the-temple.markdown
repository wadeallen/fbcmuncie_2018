As we explore 1 Kings 7:13-51, we read a detailed account of the temple furniture. Attention to detail and tangible reminders of God's salvation mark each piece. The temple reminds us that our sins need to be wiped clean before a holy God. The temple helps us understand Jesus' work on the cross for the forgiveness of our sins.
