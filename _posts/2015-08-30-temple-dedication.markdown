In 1 Kings 8:1-9:9, we witness the extraordinary gathering of God's people as they dedicate and celebrate the completion of the temple. Solomon prays for the people to remain steadfast. He prays for God's grace and mercy in times of failure. God then speaks to Solomon. He warns of destruction if the people forsake Him. As we consider the highs and lows of our spiritual lives, may we strive toward faithfulness.
