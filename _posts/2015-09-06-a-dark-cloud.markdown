In 1 Kings 9:10-25, a dark cloud looms over Solomon's kingdom. As we read the description of Solomon's building projects, we find hints that he is walking further away from God's desire. While he is still attending the festivals at the temple, everything else in his life seems contrary to God's rule and reign. As we consider this text, we are challenged to consider ways in which compromise creeps into our lives.
