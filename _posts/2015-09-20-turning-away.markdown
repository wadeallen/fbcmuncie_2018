For several weeks, we have been aware of a dark cloud in the story of Solomon. While God has richly blessed him, he appears halfhearted toward the things of God. In 1 Kings 11, we see Solomon's apathetic spirituality come to fruition. God has had enough and responds to Solomon's pagan worship practices. As we consider our own spirituality, may the story of Solomon prompt us toward greater attentiveness to the small compromises in our lives.
