As we explore 1 Kings 11:14-43, we find Solomon in the wake of God's judgment. God told Solomon that He is not happy with the fact that he is worshiping idols. He is going to take the kingdom from Solomon's decendants, but this is not going to happen during Solomon's lifetime. Yet in this chapter, we see that God is putting the peices in place for this judgment. How is Solomon going to respond? Rather than repenting from his sin, he is defiant. Solomon is not like his father David in this respect. We will explore this story and compare it to David when he was confronted with his failures.
