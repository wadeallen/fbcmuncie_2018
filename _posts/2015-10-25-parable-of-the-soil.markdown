As we engage our first parable in our five week series on parables, we come to the parable of the soil. Jesus relates the work of God's kingdom as a farmer scattering seed. Jesus describes the possibilities for the scattered seed based on the condition of the soil. We are challenged in our response to the message of the kingdom as we engage this story. Matthew 13:1-23
