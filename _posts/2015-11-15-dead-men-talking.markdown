Jesus tells a story (a parable) about a rich man and a poor man. In their death, they find themselves in the afterlife. The roles are now reversed and the rich man is in Hell while the poor man is now at Abrahamâ€™s side. As we study this story together, may we consider how our lives in this world will impact the next.
