We do not need to be good to be forgiven, we need to be honest about ourselves and repentant. In this parable, Jesus confronts the pride of the religious leaders. He affirms that righteousness with God is a matter of grace and mercy and encourages us to approach God with a spirit of humility. Luke 18:9-14
