The song Twelve Days of Christmas remind us that Christmas does not happen on one day. In fact, it actually begins on Christmas Day and goes through the evening of January 5. January 6 is the celebration of Epiphany. This celebration marks the events of Matthew 2, the coming of the three kings (wise men). We will explore the story of the wise men, separating myth from reality. The Magi offer insight into Jesus' life and purpose.
