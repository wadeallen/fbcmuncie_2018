One of the first acts of Jesus' ministry is his baptism. In Luke 3:15-22, we find John the Baptist pointing to Jesus as the Messiah. As Jesus submits to baptism, he experiences the presence and empowerment of the Spirit and the Father. The Trinity (the Godhead, three in one) is an essential aspect of Jesus' earthly ministry and should be central to us as followers of Jesus.
