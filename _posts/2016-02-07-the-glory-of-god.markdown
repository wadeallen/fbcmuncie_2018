The Transfiguration is a key event in the life and mission of Jesus. As Jesus invites his closest disciples to join him on a mountaintop, they experience an unprecedented manifestation of God's glory displayed through Jesus. On this Transfiguration Sunday, we will discuss God's glory exhibited in the Old Testament and talk about the way the Transfiguration reveals His glory as now in Jesus alone.
