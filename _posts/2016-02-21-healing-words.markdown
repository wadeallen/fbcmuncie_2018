As Jesus and his companions descend from the Mount of Transfiguration, they are met by a crowd (the next day). Having experienced God's glory on the mountain, they are met with the tradegy of a demon possessed son. The father cries out for healing and Jesus restores. This story reminds us that God's glory is not just on the mountain. It is also found in the brokenness of our world. The majesty of God is revealed through this healing and speaks to the brokenness of our world in 2016.
