Phil Collins, professor at Taylor University, will be preaching in worship. On Saturday, March 5, Dr. Collins will be presenting a  highly interactive workshop, helping participants to reflect on the skills of engaging Scripture. Participants will receive a workbook that equips them to reflect on Scripture (the workbook explains the foundation of Scripture engagement, provides training on a variety of Scripture engagement practices, and includes numerous resources for further study).
