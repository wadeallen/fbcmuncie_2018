Neil Kring, pastor of The Revolution Church in Muncie, is our guest speaker on this day. Neil is married to Kelly and they have give children, Taylor, Dyllan, Wesley, Jaelen, Colbey.  Neil enjoys reading, talking and telling stories, taking baths, the outdoors, basketball, bikes, movies, and hip-hop music. Neil's love for ministry includes helping people come to Jesus and experience the gospel, helping people have hope, addressing the lies we believe about ourselves, teaching from the Bible, dreaming what could be if we all submitted our lives to the values of Christâ€™s kingdom. We are grateful to have Neil with us this morning.
