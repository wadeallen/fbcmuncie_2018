In Luke's account of the empty tomb, we find bewildered women making a trip to anoint Jesus' body. They do not expect what comes next. They experience the empty tomb and hurry to tell the others. No one believes them, but Peter has enough faith to check it out on his own. This first, of three stories in Luke 24, reveals the reality of the Resurrection to an unbelieving, faithless group of followers. However, in time, Jesus will empower their faith. We too, may doubt or struggle with the resurrection of Jesus. As we gather on Easter, may God give us all that need to embrace and live into his Resurrection.
