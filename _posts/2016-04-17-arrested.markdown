As we join the Revolution Church in worship, we step into the story of the early church in Acts. We join Paul as he is attacked by an angry mob in Jerusalem. God rescues him through the Romans and places Paul in a trail before the religious leaders. Paul boldly proclaims his faith and is assured by God that he will continue to be used to proclaim the Gospel. As we reflect on Paul's courage, we are challenged to stand firm in the midst of difficult circumstances.
