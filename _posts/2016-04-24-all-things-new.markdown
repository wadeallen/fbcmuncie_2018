The lectionary passage for the week takes us into the final book of the bible; we will only spend one week here. In Revelation 21, we get a glimpse of how the story ends. This picture of the end of time (as we know it) prompts us to anticipate God's provision for us. In this new world, evil is banished and God's presence overwhelms us.
