The founders of TreeFort Ministries will be in worship on May 1. Justin and Sandy Ullom will be sharing their story and vision of what God has been doing in their lives. Treefort is in the process of creating a home for at-risk boys in northern Delaware County. The initiative, led by a board of directors, represents a safe and fun haven boys to grow and develop in healthy homes.  There is no doubting the work of God as Treefort has grown from an idea to an actual place, and soon to be a new home under construction.
