As we conclude the Gospel of Luke, we find the disciples witnessing the ascension of Jesus. They watch as he is lifted into heaven. In time, Jesus' followers will be empowered by the Holy Spirit to live out God's mission in this world. We might imagine their response as one of fear and uncertainty. Yet we discover a disposition of worship as they watch Jesus disappear from their sight. As we consider the ascension of Jesus, we are summoned to continue his mission in our world.
