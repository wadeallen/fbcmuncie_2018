Andrew is seldom mentioned in Scripture as compared to his famous brother, Peter. Yet Andrew is one of the first followers of Jesus and is responsible for introducing Peter to Him. As we study the life of Andrew, his behind-the-scenes presence serves an important function in Jesus' ministry. We are challenged to feature the crucial task of serving in the background as we focus on Peter's brother, Andrew.
