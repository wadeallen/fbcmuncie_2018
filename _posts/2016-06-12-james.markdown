James, the brother of John, is described as zealous, passionate and even reckless. Two stories give us insight into this key leader among the twelve. While these stories do not elevate James, they reveal the work Jesus needed to do in him. In the end, James gives his life as the first apostle to be martyred (the only disciple's death to be included in the Bible). We are challenged by his faithfulness to submit to the mission of Jesus.
