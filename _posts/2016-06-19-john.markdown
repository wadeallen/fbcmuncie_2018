The apostle John is one of the most familiar of the twelve. He authored more of the New Testament than any other disciple. Yet, John would probably not want accolades for this distinction. As we study his life, we see how he was transformed from a reckless, prideful, position grabbing young man to a humble, obedient, loving follower of Jesus. John's long life and vast experience challenge us as we are being transformed by Jesus in like ways.
