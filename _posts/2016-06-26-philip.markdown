Philip was a by-the-book kind of person. In the few places where he is named, we find him skeptical, reluctant and hesitant. We will look at three stories in which Philip is mentioned. In the end, Philip becomes a powerful preacher of the message of Jesus. As we continue our study of the disciples, we are challenged to allow God to transform us in like ways.
