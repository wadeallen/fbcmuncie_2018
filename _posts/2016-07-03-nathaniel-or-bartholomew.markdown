We will gather in a combined worship service during the late worship hour on this holiday weekend. Bill Eidson will be continuing our study on the Twelve as he talks about Nathanael, also called Bartholomew. Most Bible scholars believe Nathanael and Bartholomew were the same person. A close companion to Philip, Nathanael's is rarely mentioned in Scripture. However, his honest and sincere approach to faith is model for us.
