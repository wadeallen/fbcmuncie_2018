Matthew is perhaps the most surprising disciple. While we know little about him, we do he was a tax collector. One might think that such an vocation would exclude him from becoming an apostle. Yet Jesus offers an opportunity for Matthew to leave his sin and follow him. Matthew's life declares the mission of Jesus in our world; Jesus did not come for the righteous, but for the sinners.
