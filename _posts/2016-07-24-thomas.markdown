We all think of Thomas as the doubter. Yet pessimism is a better descriptor. John records three occasions where Thomas speaks. On each occasion, his words reveal the negative possibilities of the situation. Jesus is gentle with Thomas; he understands his suspicion and cynicism. In time, Thomas will find that Jesus engulfs his doubt and gives him all he needs to believe. Thomas' life is model for all who see the glass half empty instead of half full.
