The first three disciples in the final group are obscure; we know very little about them. However, we are able to pick up tidbits of information that help us get to know them. We discover that James the Less is defined by ambiguity; he lives in the shadow of the other disciples. Simon the Zealot's background must have been a challenge for Jesus and the other disciples. He was willing to relinquish his agenda as he was transformed by Jesus. Finally, Judas (Lebbaeus Thaddaeus) seems to be a tenderhearted disciple who follows Jesus to the end.
