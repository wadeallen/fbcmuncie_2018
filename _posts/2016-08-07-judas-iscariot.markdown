Judas Iscariot is one of the most famous disciples but for all the wrong reasons. His life is a life of tragedy to the fullest extent. While he had the opportunity to serve as a disciple of Jesus, he allowed Satan to use him for perhaps the most dreadful acts in all of history, betraying the Son of God.
