Ten youth served as missionaries at Camp Barnabas July 8-15. At Camp Barnabas, perspectives are changed and disability is redefined. Our campers are empowered by the love, acceptance and encouragement they receive during their week at camp. Through adaptive activities, our campers are told yes. They can be normal for a week.  Our missionaries help to give our campers experiences that will impact them forever. They leave with a new friend and a changed life. Camp Barnabas goes beyond just a week of camp, it becomes life-changing.
