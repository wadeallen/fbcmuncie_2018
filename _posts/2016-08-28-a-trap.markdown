We are living in a world of increasing violence and turmoil. Yet the ancient words from Proverbs 1:8-19 provide warning to reject the path of greed and brutality. The way of wisdom is the path of peace. As we gather together, we collectively confess the path that Jesus calls us toward in contrast to the way of the wicked.
