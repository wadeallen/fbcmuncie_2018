In the second chapter of Proverbs, we are encouraged to actively seek wisdom from the Lord. As we allow wisdom to become a part of us (make its way into our hearts), it will protect us from the lure of evil in our world. As decoys attempt to subvert our journey toward God's ways, wisdom will give us what we need for straight paths.
