This short text provides powerful application in our relationship with God. Solomon reminds us to trust God in seasons of plenty and seasons of pain. When abundance describes our condition, it is wise to give lavishly. In turn, God will provide all we need. When difficult circumstances overwhelm us, it is wise to count on the fact that God has our best interest in mind.
