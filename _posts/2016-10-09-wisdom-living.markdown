We sometimes wonder if wisdom is a big deal? We envision it as a nice addition to our lives. In Proverbs 3:13-35, we learn the crucial nature of wisdom. Wisdom is more precious than anything our world has to offer. A wisdom filled life is one that is lived with open hands, a peaceful path and a humble spirit.
