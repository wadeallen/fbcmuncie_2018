On the first Sunday of Advent, we consider Paul's words to the Romans. With a sense of urgency, he prompts them to awaken to what God is doing in the world. The time is near and Paul calls us to live in the spiritual day and avoid the traps of the night. As we anticipate the coming of Jesus in Christmas, may we examine our own lives, waking up to what God is doing in the here and now.
