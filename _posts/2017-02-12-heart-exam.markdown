In the season of Valentine's Day, we think a lot about hearts. In Matthew 5:21-37, Jesus is not talking about romantic love. He calls us to examine our hearts in terms of sin. As we continue our study on Jesus' words, we are challenged to allow God to do the inner work of transforming our hearts. Adjusting our actions is impossible without a change of heart.
