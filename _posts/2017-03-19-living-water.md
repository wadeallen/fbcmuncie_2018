The story of the Samaritan woman at the well is another familiar story. Jesus breaks all social protocols as he engages her in conversation. As she slowly accepts Jesus' message, she finds healing in every way. We explore this story to see how God might be breaking through our systems of exclusion to bring us into His Kingdom.
