As Peter addresses early Christians in the context of a pagan Roman Empire, he encourages them to keep in mind all that God has done and all He will continue to do. This hope propels their ability to live holy lives. And their new lives are eternal. While the pull of their old lives will continue to tempt, they should take on the posture of a newborn baby longing for the spiritual nourishment of God's Word.
