Peter describes the work that God has been doing throughout all of history culminating in Jesus. In turn, God has involved us. We are described as living stones being laid on the foundation of Jesus. As God builds his Kingdom, many will reject his work. Nevertheless, we are urged to realize our role and join God on his mission.
