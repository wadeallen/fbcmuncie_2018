The Christians of the first century are undergoing persecution because of their faith. Suffering should not be a surprise. In fact, Peter reorients their understanding of suffering as part of God's will for them. In the end, their suffering will be redeemed. They must trust that God has their best interest in mind and will turn their hardship into glory.
