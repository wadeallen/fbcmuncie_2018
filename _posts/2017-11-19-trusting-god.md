As we near the conclusion of our series in 1 Peter, we are reminded to continue lives of submission and humility. An aspect of living humble lives is trusting that God will take care of us. At the same time, we must remain alert to the attacks of the evil one standing firm and resisting. All in all, God will give us what we need and will see us through. As we gather in a combined service and celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday, we remember what it means to live our faith.
