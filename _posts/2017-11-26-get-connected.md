As we conclude our study in 1 Peter, we survey Peter's closing remarks. His words offer insight into how the church in the first century functioned. In turn, we are challenged to be a family to one another as we struggle to adjust to our changing culture. We are called to stand firm in a world that no longer holds to the values of the Kingdom of God.
