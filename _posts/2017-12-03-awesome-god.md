Advent is the season of waiting, yearning for God to show up. The Old Testament prophets lived in the tension of two truths. God is able to deliver His people. Yet, His people are in terrible shape. Are they beyond repair? Why would God respond to a people so far gone? It is in this tension that Isaiah calls for God to respond. In Isaiah 64, Isaiah pleads for God to do the impossible, to redeem His people.
