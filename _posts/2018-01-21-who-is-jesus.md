Mark describes several encounters that Jesus has with the religious leaders. As we review five narratives in Mark 2:1-3:12, we see a common pattern. Jesus or his disciples act. They are questioned by the religious leaders. Jesus speaks to his calling, his mission, his identity. As we move along in Mark's account, we encounter Jesus' bold claims that will lead to his death.
