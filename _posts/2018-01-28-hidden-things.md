As we explore the message of Jesus, as recorded by Mark, we find him speaking to the crowds in parables. Many do not understand and believe. But for those who are seeking God, his word will grow and produce a great harvest. We are challenged to open our ears and hearts to Jesus' words so that his Kingdom can take root in our lives.
