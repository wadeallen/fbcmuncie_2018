As Mark continues to relate the story of Jesus, we are beginning to see patterns. Jesus' constant conflict with the religious leaders, the miracles that reveal Jesus' power over creation and his disciples lack of understanding all characterize his ministry. The final miracle in this week's text is an image of the disciples realization of Jesus' true identity and mission.
