As we continue the story of Jesus, we find it easy to confess Him as Messiah. Yet when it comes down to it, following Jesus is not easy. The path of Jesus involves suffering, sacrifice, giving up. As we journey with Jesus and his disciples through the story, we find that we are often like the disciples. We lack the faith do be all that God calls us to be. Yet as we depend on Jesus' power, we can find all that is necessary to be authentic followers of Jesus.
