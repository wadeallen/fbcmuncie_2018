As we come to Mark 10, we are exposed to the obstacles that keep people from following Jesus. The religious leaders are more concerned with trapping Jesus than hearing him. The disciples miss the point of the Kingdom on more than one occasion. Yet toward the end of this chapter, we are given an image of a once-blind man following Jesus into Jerusalem. Jesus is determined to give his all for the sins of the world. Will we follow him?
