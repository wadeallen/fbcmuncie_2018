It is Resurrection Sunday and we gather to celebrate the Risen Christ. We conclude our series on the book of Mark as we explore Mark 16. We will also reference Matthew 28 to get a full picture of this account. Because of the Risen Christ, death is defeated and the Kingdom of God can be established.
