Jesus' third appearance to his disciples took place in the same region, same area where he initially invited them to follow him. As he shared breakfast with them, he restored their failures and called them to renew their commit to follow him. As we consider this story, we are challenged to consider our sins/failures and how Jesus desires to restore us.
