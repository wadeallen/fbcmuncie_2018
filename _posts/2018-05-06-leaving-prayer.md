As Jesus prepares for his departure, he prays. In John 17, we can learn much from Jesus' prayer for his disciples and for us. We discover that God's mission includes leaving us in the midst of a dangerous world in order to expose God's love. We are challenged by this prayer toward unity and holiness as we live out God's calling.
