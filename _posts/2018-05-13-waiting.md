On Ascension Sunday, we consider the events surrounding the Ascension of Jesus. While the disciples were looking for a timeline and specific details about what was coming next, Jesus calls them trust and wait. As we consider the arduous task of waiting, we are encouraged that God will provide what we need in His time.
