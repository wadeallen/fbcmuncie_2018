On Pentecost Sunday, we gather to celebrate the birth of the church. The church is the gathered people of God; it is not a building. The church is also a mystery described as the Body of Christ, the Bride of Christ and the Family of God. The church in the book of Acts helps us to discern God's calling for our church.
