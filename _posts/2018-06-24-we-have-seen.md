As we begin a four week series in 1 John, we explore the opening words of this epistle. John relates his experience with the eternal Word of Life. He proclaims his first hand experience (seeing, touching, hearing) to refute false theories of a non-physical Jesus. In turn, we can join with John in the life that only Jesus can give.
