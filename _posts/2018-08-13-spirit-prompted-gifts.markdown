 We continue to study the Holy Spirit this week in worship. For the past two weeks, we have explored gospel stories in which Jesus teaches us about the Holy Spirit. Both encounters (Samaritan woman and Nicodemus) reveal the purifying, new life sort of work that the Holy Spirit does in us. We have considered how the Holy Spirit is like water, like wind. We have envisioned the renewing work of the Holy Spirit as He points us to Jesus.

 This week, we shift our focus just a bit. We will be looking closely at the way the Holy Spirit empowers the church to be the church. We will look at 1 Corinthians 12:4-14 as Paul describes Spirit-prompted gifts. I hope you will take a few minutes to read this passage as you prepare for worship on Sunday. See you there!

>(1 Corinthians 12:4-14 NIV) There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them. There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work. Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues. All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to each one, just as he determines. Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ. For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many.
