It is hard to believe that we have been in Muncie for a decade now. I am looking forward to celebrating this milestone with you on Sunday in worship. We will gather in a combined worship service at 10:45 AM (all Sunday school classes will meet at 9:15 AM) to celebrate together all that God has done in our church in the past decade.

As you might know, we are in a series on the Holy Spirit. I can not think of a more appropriate topic for this anniversary celebration. Our coming to Muncie was certainly a Holy Spirit inspired process. For those of you who were not around First Baptist ten years ago, you will hear the story of how we came to be your pastor. For those of you who were around, Sunday will be a time to remember all that God has done in our midst.
