It was wonderful to celebrate with you this past weekend. We continue to reflect the wonderful service and meal. A key emphasis in our worship service was the Holy Spirit's movement among us ten years ago. We are glad that we were open to the Holy Spirit then and pray that we will continue to heed His calling in the future. 

This week, we come to our final sermon in our series on the Holy Spirit. While this series could go on for several more weeks, we will conclude it on Sunday. This week, we will look at Paul's final words to the church at Ephesus. Final words are important words and Paul chooses his language carefully. 

Let me encourage you to read Ephesians 6:10-20 as you prepare for worship on Sunday. Perhaps you have read this passage before and focused on the various aspects of the armor of the Lord. This is usually how I read this passage. Let me encourage you to read the entire passage and then go back and reread verse 18. 

I hope you have a wonderful week. See you on Sunday.
