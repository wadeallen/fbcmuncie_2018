We begin a new pattern this week in worship. If you have read the *Visitor*, you know that we will be using the *Narrative Lectionary* until May. Like the *Revised Common Lectionary*, we will be working with a prescribed set of passages. Yet, the *Narrative Lectionary* intentionally moves through the story of God. I am looking forward to journeying with you through the story. 

This week, we come to the story of Noah. While Noah is not at the *very* beginning of the Bible, Noah's story is *a* beginning. The human race had been on a downward spiral since Adam and Eve and by the time we come to Noah's day, God is ready to wipe it out. Genesis 6:5-6 is an intriguing verse.

>(Genesis 6:5-6 NIV) The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.

Yet God turns this sad situation into a story of salvation. This is story of Noah. Join us on Sunday as we walk though the story together. If you would like to read ahead, the passages are Genesis 6:5-22; 8:6-12; 9:8-17.
