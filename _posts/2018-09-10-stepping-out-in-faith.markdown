I found it ironic that we talked about Noah yesterday. While the banks of the White River rose, we considered the story of the Flood. I assure you that I did not plan it that way.

 This week, we move along in God's story to Genesis 12. As Noah and his family fill the earth, people groups form and spread out. The Flood did not fix the sin problem. In time, people came together and attempted to "build a name for themselves" (Genesis 11, Tower of Babel). God shows up and puts them in their place. Just a few verses later, God begins to narrow his work to one family. 

 This week, we journey ahead in God's story to Abraham, really called Abram at this point. His story is a story of faith, a story of stepping into the unknown. I hope you can join us on Sunday as we explore Genesis 12:1-9. Let me encourage you to read it as you prepare for worship on Sunday. 

 If you missed last week's sermon, you can [watch it online](http://fbcmuncie.org/video). I hope you all have a great week.


>(Genesis 12:1-9 NIV) The Lord had said to Abram, “Go from your country, your people and your father’s household to the land I will show you. “I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.” So Abram went, as the Lord had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Harran. He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Harran, and they set out for the land of Canaan, and they arrived there. Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land. The Lord appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built an altar there to the Lord, who had appeared to him. From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the Lord and called on the name of the Lord. Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev.
