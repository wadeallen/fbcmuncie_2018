The story of Joseph is one of ups and downs. Genesis 39 is about Joseph’s encounter with Potiphar’s wife. While Joseph remains faithful to God, he ends up in prison. Yet God continues to be present in Joseph’s life. In the same way, we can be assured that God is with us through every aspect of our lives.
