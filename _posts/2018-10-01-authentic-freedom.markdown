This past Sunday, we recounted the rescue of God's people from the grips of Egyptian slavery. God worked in dramatic ways to deliver His people. Yet when they faced their first challenge, they quickly doubted God and blamed Moses. Nevertheless, God acted in mighty ways and saved them. At the end of Exodus 14, we find the Israelites once again trusting God's provision.

>(Exodus 14:31 NIV) And when the Israelites saw the mighty hand of the Lord displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the Lord and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant.

Nearly seven weeks later, we find God's people at the base of Mount Sinai. God offers instructions or words to them, ten words (or commandments). We talked at length about these back in June. We will not repeat all that we discussed this summer. Yet my hope is to connect the Ten Commandments to the overall story of God. Too often we understand the commandments as a list of rules that hinder our freedom. But God is not burdening His people by offering them instruction. In fact, He is giving them authentic freedom as they discover how God desires them to live. God has created us and He knows what we need. He knows the sort of living that will allow us to function best in ongoing relationship with Him. Join us on Sunday as we explore Exodus 20:1-17 together.
