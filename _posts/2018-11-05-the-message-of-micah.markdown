We stepped into the era of the prophets last week in our study of Naaman and Elisha. If you did not have a chance to hear the sermon, let me encourage you to [watch](http://fbcmuncie.org/video/2018/11/04/wash-and-be-clean) online. We talked about the context of the prophets and all that led up to the prophets. 

This week, we open the book of Micah. Micah is a key prophet and his message serves as a key pointer to Jesus. We will dive into Micah's message from God in Micah 1:3-5; 5:2-5; 6:6-8. Let me encourage you to read ahead as you prepare for worship on Sunday.

>(Micah 1:3-5 NIV) Look! The Lord is coming from his dwelling place; he comes down and treads on the heights of the earth. The mountains melt beneath him and the valleys split apart, like wax before the fire, like water rushing down a slope. All this is because of Jacob’s transgression, because of the sins of the people of Israel. What is Jacob’s transgression? Is it not Samaria? What is Judah’s high place? Is it not Jerusalem?


>(Micah 5:2-5 NIV) “But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.” Therefore Israel will be abandoned until the time when she who is in labor bears a son, and the rest of his brothers return to join the Israelites. He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God. And they will live securely, for then his greatness will reach to the ends of the earth. And he will be our peace when the Assyrians invade our land and march through our fortresses. We will raise against them seven shepherds, even eight commanders,


>(Micah 6:6-8 NIV) With what shall I come before the Lord and bow down before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousand rivers of olive oil? Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.
