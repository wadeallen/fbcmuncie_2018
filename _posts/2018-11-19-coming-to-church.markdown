We have been in the prophets for the past few weeks. While these passages may not be on our *favorite bible verses* lists, I have enjoyed delving into them with you. This week, we come to another prophet, Jeremiah. Most of us are aware of Jeremiah; we have read his writings at one time or another. This week, we will be looking at his proclamation at the Temple in Jeremiah 7.

Jeremiah's words are extremely relevant in our world today. As we gather on Sunday for worship, we will be reminded of the true purpose of our coming together. God is less concerned with our going through the religious motions and more concerned with our hearts before him. We will also consider Jesus' words at the temple in Matthew 21:12-13. 

Let me encourage you to read these passages at you prepare for worship on Sunday.

>(Jeremiah 7:1-11 NIV) This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: “Stand at the gate of the Lord’s house and there proclaim this message: “‘Hear the word of the Lord, all you people of Judah who come through these gates to worship the Lord. This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Reform your ways and your actions, and I will let you live in this place. Do not trust in deceptive words and say, “This is the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord!” If you really change your ways and your actions and deal with each other justly, if you do not oppress the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow and do not shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not follow other gods to your own harm, then I will let you live in this place, in the land I gave your ancestors for ever and ever. But look, you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless. “‘Will you steal and murder, commit adultery and perjury, burn incense to Baal and follow other gods you have not known, and then come and stand before me in this house, which bears my Name, and say, “We are safe”—safe to do all these detestable things? Has this house, which bears my Name, become a den of robbers to you? But I have been watching! declares the Lord.

>(Matthew 21:12-13 NIV) Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. “It is written,” he said to them, “‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you are making it ‘a den of robbers.’”
