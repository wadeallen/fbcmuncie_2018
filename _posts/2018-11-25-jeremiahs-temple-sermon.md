The words of Jeremiah in the Temple challenge modern readers to examine their understanding of the church. Many attend church to enhance their lives or to seek blessing from God. Instead, God desires for his people to submit their lives to his rule and reign. Perhaps our worship will prompt us to reconsider how we live our everyday lives.
