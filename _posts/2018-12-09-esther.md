The season of Advent is a time of waiting, trusting, depending on God to act and move. In the story of Esther, God calls a young queen to risk it all. Her cousin Mordecai prods her to step out in faith in order to save her people. In the end, Esther submits her life to God. As we consider her story, might we consider how God has placed us and called us to serve him.
