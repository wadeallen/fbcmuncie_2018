On this third Sunday of Advent, we continue to anticipate God showing up. We read from Isaiah 42 and consider how Jesus fulfills these ancient words. As God promised through Isaiah, Jesus' work of one of rescue, restoration that will make its way into the entire world. May we join God's work as we shine the light of Jesus into our world.
