The first event in the ministry of Jesus takes place in the wilderness. John the Baptist, in Elijah-like style, calls out to those seeking God's movement in the world. He tells them to be ready. God is on the move once again and is bringing his kingdom to earth. Jesus appears in the wilderness and is baptized by John. The Spirit anoints him and the Father's voice affirms his identity. Are we ready to repent and join God in all that he is doing?
