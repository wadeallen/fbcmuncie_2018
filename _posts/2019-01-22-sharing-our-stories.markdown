A few months ago, Julie Davis asked me if she could meet to talk about something that God had placed on her heart. We met and discussed a wonderful project that is now underway at First Baptist. We would like to share more about this project with you this week in worship. We will remain in our Matthew series as we look at a set of familiar verses from Matthew 5.

>(Matthew 5:13-16 NIV) “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.

Jesus encourages us to allow our lives to be salt and light in our dark and tasteless world. One way that we might do this is by sharing our faith stories. Join us on Sunday as we gather to talk about the crucial place our stories play in the Kingdom of God.
