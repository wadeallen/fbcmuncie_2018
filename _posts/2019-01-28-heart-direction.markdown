For the next several weeks, we will be looking at the teachings of Jesus from Matthew. You will probably find these passages familiar. Yet each instruction is an opportunity to examine our lives, our hearts. Are we living as Jesus intends for us to live? Do we have tendencies, habits or mindsets that are contrary to Jesus' way of living? This week, we come to Matthew 6:19-21. 

>(Matthew 6:19-21 NIV) â€œDo not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

We often apply these verses to money, our checkbooks. Yet this passage reaches beyond our financial resources. Join us on Sunday as we explore how we might direct our storehouses so that our hearts will gravitate towards God's mission in our world.
