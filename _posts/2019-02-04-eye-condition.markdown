Each week, I spend time in commentaries reading the *experts* in the field of bible research. I enjoy delving deep into matters of biblical interpretation. As I was preparing this week's sermon, I was fascinated by the subheading (for this week's scripture) in a commentary. It was entitled *Plank Eye*. This phrase is memorable. Just as *pink eye*, we might consider it a condition that needs treatment. 

When Jesus speaks in Matthew 7:1-12, I am certain that the image of a *plank* or *log* in one's eye caused the first hearers to giggle. Jesus is using hyperbole to reveal this condition. Join us on Sunday as we explore Matthew 7:1-12. Let me encourage you to read it as you prepare for worship on Sunday.

>(Matthew 7:1-12 NIV) “Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye. “Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. “Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.
