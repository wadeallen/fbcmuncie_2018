As we are moving toward Easter, we are a bit later this year. Easter is not until April 21. Therefore, Lent does not begin until next week. We find ourselves this week at Transfiguration Sunday. This is a key story and so we cover it almost every year. This year, we will find ourselves in Matthew's version of the story. Most will remember this account. Jesus invites his key disciples to join him on a trip to the top of a mountain. They then witness him transfigured before them. It is a fantastic event and will solidify Jesus' resolve to move toward the cross. Join us on Sunday as we explore the story together. Let me encourage you to read the passage as you prepare for worship this week.

>(Matthew 16:24-17:8 NIV) Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it. What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul? For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done. “Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.” After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus. Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!” When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified. But Jesus came and touched them. “Get up,” he said. “Don’t be afraid.” When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.
