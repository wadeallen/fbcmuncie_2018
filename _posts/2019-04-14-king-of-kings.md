As Jesus enters the city of Jerusalem just a few days before his death, he rides a colt, clears the temple and boldly proclaims his Messiah-ship. As we consider Matthew 21:1-17, we walk with Jesus into the danger he faces as a result of this claim. All the while, we can only worship as the children in the passage.
