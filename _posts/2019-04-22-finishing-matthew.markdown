One of the most familiar passages in all of the New Testament is Matthew 28:16-20. We refer to this set of verses as the Great Commission. Books have expanded on these verses to describe Jesus' intention for church growth. Church mission statements have often highlighted these instructions. This week, we conclude our study of Matthew with this reading. Let me invite you to take a few minutes to survey Matthew 28:16-20 as you prepare for worship. See you on Sunday.

>(Matthew 28:16-20 NIV) Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”
