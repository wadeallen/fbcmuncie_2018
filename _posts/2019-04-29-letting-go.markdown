As we move through the Easter season, we will find ourselves moving from story to story. We will also have a special sermon next week on Mother's Day about Adam and Eve. This week, we find ourselves in the book of Acts. Peter is a key leader in the early church. In Acts 10, he is surprised by the movement of God. As we study the story of Peter and Cornelius, we are challenged in our willingness to allow the Holy Spirit to speak into our lives. Sometimes we hold tightly to "the way we do things". Let me invite you to read Acts 10 as you prepare for worship on Sunday. Since it is a longer passage, I will link to it in this entry. See you on Sunday.
