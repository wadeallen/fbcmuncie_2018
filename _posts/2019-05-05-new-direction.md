The story of Cornelius and Peter in Acts 10 is a challenging story. God dramatically opens Peter's eyes to a new direction, a new way. Peter has to decide if he will follow God into this unfamiliar place or if he will dig his heels into the safe and secure. As we read this story, we are reminded that God will often surprise us and call us into new ways of understanding.
