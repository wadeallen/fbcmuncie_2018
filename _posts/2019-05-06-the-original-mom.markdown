Just in case you need a reminder, Sunday is Mother's Day. This year, we will be going all the way to Genesis as we consider God's creation of mothers. In a world where gender and sexuality debates are commonplace, we will consider God's design in Genesis 2. Let me encourage you to read ahead as you prepare for Sunday's worship. And don't forget to recognize the special women in your life.

>(Genesis 2:18-25 NIV) The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.” Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. But for Adam no suitable helper was found. So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs and then closed up the place with flesh. Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. The man said, “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’ for she was taken out of man.” That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh. Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.
