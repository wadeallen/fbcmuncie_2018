Luke 24 records three encounters. Last week, we studied the women at the tomb. However, Easter does not end with this story. Today, we pick up with two disciples on a journey to Emmauus. They are confused, discouraged when they encounter the risen Christ. They do not recognize Jesus until thier journey is over. As we join them on this journey, we are able to see how Jesus empowers thier faith. In the same way, our doubts and confusion can be changed into intense faith as we encounter the story of God.
