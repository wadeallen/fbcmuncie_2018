During this Easter season, we have discussed several of the resurrection appearances of Jesus. Last week, we considered the disciples on the road to Emmaus. Jesus did not boldly appear; he allowed the disciples to express their doubt and confusion before revealing himself. In this week's study, we will explore Jesus' interaction with his disciples. The interplay of conversation in these appearances teaches us about God's purpose and mission in the world. I hope you will join us on Sunday and read Luke 24:36-49 in preparation for worship.

>(Luke 24:36-49 NIV) While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.” They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.” When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate it in their presence. He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.” Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. He told them, “This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”
