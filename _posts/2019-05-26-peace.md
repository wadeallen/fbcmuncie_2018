As we study the third encounter of the Risen Christ in Luke 24, we find a gathered group of faithless, fearful disciples. Yet when Jesus appears to them, he brings peace to their strife. He brings clarity to God's story and their role in it.As we study this encounter, we are reminded of our role as followers of Jesus. We are called to believe, to trust, to wait on the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives as we join God on his mission in our world.
