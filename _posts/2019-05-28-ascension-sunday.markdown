As we continue to make our way to Pentecost Sunday (June 9), we come this week to Ascension Sunday (June 2). Over the past few weeks, we have been talking about Jesus' post-resurrection appearances to his disciples. This week, we consider his ascension. I hope you will take a few minutes to read the passage before Sunday's worship service. Also, just a reminder that we will be serving a light lunch downstairs following the late worship hour to celebrate the baptisms that will take place on Sunday. We hope you will plan on joining us.


>(Luke 24:44-53 NIV) He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.” Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. He told them, “This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.” When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.
