This past Sunday, we discussed the implications of Jesus' ascension. Certainly, Jesus' life, death and resurrection are essential to our living in the Kingdom of God. As Jesus departs, he teaches his disciples how he has fulfilled the law, the prophets and all that God has been doing since the beginning of time. But there is more to the story. Jesus told his disciples,

>(Luke 24:49 NIV) I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.‚Äù

This week, we come to the story of Pentecost. For 10 days, the disciples have followed Jesus' instruction. They have been waiting, worshiping. And then in Acts 2, we read what happens next. Join us on Sunday as we explore the story of Pentecost. Let me encourage you to read the story as you prepare for worship on Sunday. Since the text is long, I will include a link to the passage.
