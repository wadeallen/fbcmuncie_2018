Pentecost Sunday was a fantastic day. It was a privilege to take part in Lily Rodriquez's dedication as David and Kelly stood before us committing to raise her in the Lord. We also recalled the story of Acts 2, the coming of the Holy Spirit. We collectively prayed for God's continual Holy Spirit empowering of our church. What a great time to be together!

This coming Sunday is also a special Sunday. It is both Trinity Sunday and Father's Day. This year, we will consider God's call for fathers from Ephesians 6:1-4. I hope you will read this passage as you prepare for worship on Sunday.

In my sermon preparation for our Revelation series, I came across a new translation by New Testament scholar, N.T. Wright. I have found the language both helpful and fresh. I will include this week's passage in this translation. It is called *The New Testament for Everyone*. I hope you have a wonderful week and anticipate seeing you on Sunday.

>(Ephesians 6:1-4 NTE) Children, obey your parents in the Lord. This is right and proper.  ‘Honour your father and your mother’ – this is the first commandment that comes with a promise attached! –  ‘so that things may go well with you and that you may live a long life on earth.’ Fathers, don’t make your children angry. Bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.
