Just a quick note to remind you that we will be gathering in a combined worship service this week at 10:45 AM due to the holiday weekend.

I am excited to let you know that we will also begin our study on the book of Revelation this week. Preparation for this series began several months ago; we are finally diving in this week. We will be easing into the study with only 8 verses this week. Please take a few minutes to read these verses. I will include them here for you in the NTE (New Testament for Everyone) translation.

>(Revelation 1:1-8 NTE) Revelation of Jesus the Messiah! God gave it to him to show his servants what must soon take place. He signified it by sending a message through his angel to his servant John,  who, by reporting all he saw, bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus the Messiah.  God’s blessing on the one who reads the words of this prophecy, and on those who hear them and keep what is written in it. The time, you see, is near! John, to the seven churches in Asia: grace to you and peace from He Who Is and Who Was and Who Is To Come, and from the seven spirits that are before his throne,  and from Jesus the Messiah, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. Glory to the one who loved us, and freed us from our sins by his blood,  and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and father – glory and power be to him for ever and ever. Amen. Look! He is coming with the clouds, and every eye shall see him; yes, even those who pierced him. All the tribes of the earth shall mourn because of him. Yes! Amen. ‘I am the Alpha and the Omega,’ says the Lord God, Who Is and Who Was and Who Is To Come, the Almighty.

I am both excited and nervous for this series. I hope you will join me as we venture together through one of the most challenging and astonishing books of the bible.
