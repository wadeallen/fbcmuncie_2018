It was a joy to gather together in a combined worship service yesterday. We began our study of Revelation and came together around to the Lord's table. If you were not able to be with us, I would encourage to you take the time to watch the [video](https://fbcmuncie.org/video/2019/07/07/introducing-revelation) or listen to the [podcast](https://fbcmuncie.org/podcast/fbcmuncie.xml). It will be important to hear each sermon in this series in order to follow the narrative from week to week. If you miss a Sunday or two, you might feel lost when you return to worship.

I would also like to encourage to you to watch a couple of short videos. [The Bible Project](https://thebibleproject.com) is a fantastic way to learn more about the big picture of particular themes or books of the bible. They have two videos on Revelation.

These videos are very helpful and may be something you want to come back to later in the study.

We come to this week to the later part of chapter 1. I would encourage to to read Revelation 1:9-20 as you prepare for worship on Sunday. I will include these verses from the NTE translation for you in this entry.

>(Revelation 1:9-20 NTE) I, John, your brother and your partner in the suffering, the kingdom, and the patient endurance in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.  I was in the spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet.  ‘Write down what you see in a book,’ it said, ‘and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.’ So I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. As I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands,  and in the middle of the lampstands ‘one like a son of man’, wearing a full-length robe and with a golden belt across his chest.  His head and his hair were white, white like wool, white like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire,  his feet were like exquisite brass, refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many waters.  He was holding seven stars in his right hand, and a sharp two-edged sword was coming out of his mouth. The sight of him was like the sun when it shines with full power.  When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though I was dead. He touched me with his right hand. ‘Don’t be afraid,’ he said. ‘I am the first and the last  and the living one. I was dead, and look! I am alive for ever and ever. I have the keys of death and Hades.  Now write what you see, both the things that already are, and also the things that are going to happen afterwards.  The secret meaning of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, by the way, and the seven golden lampstands, is this. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches themselves.
