For the last couple of weeks, we have been moving at neck break pace through the specific instructions to the seven churches (Revelation 2 and 3). If you were not able to join us for either of these sermons, let me encourage you to [watch or listen online](https://fbcmuncie.org/keepup).

We move this week to Revelation 4. This is a dramatic picture of God's throne room. Let me warn you, there are strange images or representations in this chapter. But don't worry, we will discuss all of this on Sunday. Let me encourage you to take a few minutes to read the chapter before coming to worship on Sunday. This is a rich chapter. I will provide Revelation 4 in the NTE translation for you to read in this entry.

See you on Sunday.

>(Revelation 4 NTE) After this I looked -- and there was a door in heaven, standing open! The voice like a trumpet, which I had heard speaking with me at the beginning, spoke again. 'Come up here,' it said, 'and I will show you what must take place after these things.' At once I was in the spirit. There in heaven stood a throne, and someone was sitting on it. The seated figure had the appearance of a jasper stone or a carnelian, and there was a rainbow around the throne, looking like an emerald. Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and sitting on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clothed in white robes, and with golden crowns on their heads. Flashes of lightning, rumblings and thunderclaps were coming from the throne, and in front of the throne seven lampstands, which are the seven spirits of God, were burning with fire. In front of the throne there was something like a sea of glass, like crystal. In the middle of the throne, and all around the throne, were four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind. The first creature was like a lion, the second creature was like an ox, the third creature had a human face, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle. Each of the four creatures had six wings, and they were full of eyes all round and inside. Day and night they take no rest, as they say, 'Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who Was and Who Is and Who Is to Come.' When the creatures give glory and honour and thanksgiving to the one who is sitting on the throne, the one who lives for ever and ever, the twenty-four elders fall down in front of the one who is sitting on the throne, and worship the one who lives for ever and ever. They throw down their crowns in front of the throne, saying, 'O Lord our God, you deserve to receive glory and honour and power, because you created all things; because of your will they existed and were created.'
