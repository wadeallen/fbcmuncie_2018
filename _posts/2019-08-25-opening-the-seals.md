As the seals are opened, we might be surprised. We are exposed to great destruction and turmoil. While we may not enjoy this part of the story, it is essential to expose evil in order for salvation to take place. As we venture into Revelation 6, our questions of God's faithfulness are brought to light. But in the end, God remains on the throne.
