John returns to earth in Revelation 10, but his vision continues. A mighty angel with a loud voice presents a little scroll. John is instructed to take the scroll and eat it. As we consider the imagery of this chapter, we feel the tension of the final days. God's great restoration is fantastic, but the closing of opportunity for repentance is dire.
