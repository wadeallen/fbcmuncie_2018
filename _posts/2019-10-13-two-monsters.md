In Revelation 13, two monsters appear. They are powerful forces in the world and demand allegiance, worship. They are empowered by the dragon and are given authority over the world. The followers of the Lamb stand in contrast to the dragon and his beasts. As we consider ancient books like Daniel, we understand this imagery as spanning all times and places. While the names change, the monsters described appear throughout history. The real question is how the followers of the Lamb will resist.
