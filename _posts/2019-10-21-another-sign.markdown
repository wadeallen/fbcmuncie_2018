As we continue in our Revelation study, we keep coming back to the same themes over and over. But my hope is that they are beginning to become familiar with God's story as we cycle through it over and over. This week, we come to a pause in the story. Revelation 15 is a short chapter. But it sets the stage for all that is to come. I hope you will take a few minutes to read the passage as you prepare for worship on Sunday.

>(Revelation 15 NTE) Then I saw another signÂ -- a great, amazing sight in heaven: seven angels who were bringing the seven last plagues. With them God's anger is completed.  And I saw what looked like a sea of glass, mixed with fire. There, by that glassy sea, stood the people who had won the victory over the monster and over its image, and over the number of its name. They were holding harps of God,  and they were singing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the lamb. This is how it went:Great and amazing are your works, O Lord God, the Almighty one. Just and true are your ways, O King of the nations. Who will not fear you, Lord,and glorify your name? For you alone are holy. For all nations shall come and worship before you, because your judgments have been revealed. After this I looked, and the temple of the "tabernacle of witness" was opened in heaven.  The seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in clean, shining linen, wearing golden belts across their chests.  Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the anger of the God who lives for ever and ever.  The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and his power. Nobody was able to go into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels had been completed.
