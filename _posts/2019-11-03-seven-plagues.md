In Revelation 16, the seven bowls which are held by the seven angels are poured out. Reminding us of the Egyptian plagues, God steps into the world to begin the process of salvation. Those who experience the plagues do not repent, continuing in their evil ways. All the while, we are challenged to be ready for God to show up.
