John is carried way by one of the seven angels. He encounters a prostitute sitting on a monster or beast. Loaded with Old Testament allusions, we experience the ruin of the false substitute for God's plan for restoration. As we explore the symbols of this chapter, Rome is exposed for its true self. We are challenged in our world by the imitations of God's gifts to us.
