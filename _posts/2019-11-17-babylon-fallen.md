In Revelation 18, a mighty angel declares the fall of Babylon. The poetry in this chapter paints of picture of the fall of evil. As Babylon is an image for all evil empires, we know that John's first readers must have applied this to Rome. As we consider these descriptions, we are able to discern the characteristics of the beast's empire in contrast to the Lamb's kingdom.
