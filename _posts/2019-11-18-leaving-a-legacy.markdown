I walk down the main hallway in our church several times each week. I often find myself pausing to inspect the historical pictures on the wall. These pictures remind us that we are not the first ones to sit in the pews of First Baptist Church in Muncie. Many have come before us. With God's help, many will follow us. As we consider those who have left a legacy for us, we also consider the ways we are leaving a legacy for future generations. 

Join us on Sunday in a combined service for a special service focusing on legacy. We will gather at 10:45 AM in the sanctuary and then make our way downstairs following the service for our annual Harvest Meal. 

See you on Sunday.
