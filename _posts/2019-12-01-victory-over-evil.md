As we begin the season of Advent, we long for Jesus to show up and make all things right. In Revelation 19, we get a glimpse of how this is all going to work out. John invites us to Hallelujah (praise Yahweh) in this chapter. Why? Because evil will be destroyed and the Messiah is going to come to establish His long awaited Kingdom.
