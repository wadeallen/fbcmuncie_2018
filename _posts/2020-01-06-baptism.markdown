As we continue to move through the season of Epiphany, we come to one of first stories recorded in Jesus' adult life. It certainly marks the beginning of Jesus' earthly ministry. Both John and Luke, in their gospel accounts, begin the story with John the Baptist. Because Matthew and Luke cover the birth of Jesus, their accounts of Jesus' baptism do not come until the third chapter. We will stick with Matthew's account this year.

Let me encourage you to read the passages as you prepare for worship on Sunday.


>(Matthew 3:13-17 NIV) Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John. But John tried to deter him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?" Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented. As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
