Through the season of Epiphany, we have been moving together in the life of Jesus. Last week, we looked at a section of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount called *The Beatitudes*. We learn about the people who are blessed by God. Certainly, the list intrigues us. Those mentioned are often *not* considered blessed in our world today. Yet the good news is that our inadequacies actually provide an opportunity for God to do His work in us. We simply bring a hunger for a right-world coupled with humility. God does the rest.

This week, we continue to unpack Jesus' words on the hillside. This is a short, yet familiar passage. Jesus highlights the impact his followers will have on the world around them. Let me encourage you to take a few minutes to read this passage in preparation for worship on Sunday. I will include the passage in the NTE version below.

>(Matthew 5:13-16 NTE) "You"re the salt of the earth! But if the salt becomes tasteless, how is it going to get salty again? It's no good for anything. You might as well throw it out and walk all over it. "You"re the light of the world! A city can't be hidden if it's on top of a hill.  People don't light a lamp and put it under a bucket; they put it on a lampstand. Then it gives light to everybody in the house.  That's how you must shine your light in front of people! Then they will see what wonderful things you do, and they"ll give glory to your father in heaven.
