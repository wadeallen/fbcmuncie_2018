This Sunday is last Sunday in the season of Epiphany. As you might remember, it is called Transfiguration Sunday. And guess what we will be talking about? You've got it, the Transfiguration. If you have been around First Baptist, we have covered this story many times. But it is a story worth coming back to each year. Join us on Sunday as we explore Matthew's version of the encounter. 

Let me encourage you to read Matthew 17:1-9 in preparation for Sunday. I will include it below in the NTE version.

>(Matthew 17:1-9 NTE) After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and James's brother John, and led them off up a high mountain by themselves.  There he was transformed in front of them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.  Then, astonishingly, Moses and Elijah appeared to them. They were talking with Jesus. Peter just had to say something. "Master," he said to Jesus, "it's wonderful for us to be here! If you want, I'll, make three shelters hereÂ -- one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah!" While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Then there came a voice out of the cloud. "This is my dear son," said the voice, "and I'm delighted with him. Pay attention to him." When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were scared out of their wits.  Jesus came up and touched them."Get up," he said, "and don't be afraid." When they raised their eyes, they saw nobody except Jesus, all by himself. As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them strict instructions. "Don't tell anyone about the vision," he said, "until the son of man has been raised from the dead."
