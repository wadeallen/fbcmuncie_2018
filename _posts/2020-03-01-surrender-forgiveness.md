Peter asks Jesus an honest question. He wants to know how far forgiveness can go. How many times do we forgive? Jesus answers his question with a story, a parable. In Matthew 18:21-35, we are challenged with the parable of the unforgiving servant. As we read the story, we relate to the astonishing inconsistency. For those of us who have received forgiveness, we discover the necessity to do the same for others.
