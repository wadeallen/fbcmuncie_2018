As we approach the second Sunday in the season of Lent, we are anticipating a wonderful worship service. If you remember, we will be gathering in a combined service at 10:45 AM. Dr. Bill Shiell, the President of Northern Seminary, will be preaching. We have several other components in our worship on Sunday that will make it a special day. Finn and Veda Massoth will be baptized. The service will also include a special emphasis on children, with children involved in various aspects of the service. You will want to be there.

Following the service, we will gather for a church friends lunch downstairs. I have included a link to Bill's bio on the Northern Seminary website as well as the passage for this week. I hope you will take a few minutes to look over each one as you prepare for worship on Sunday.

[Bill Shiell's bio](https://www.seminary.edu/faculty/william-d-shiell/)

>(Matthew 19:13-15 NIV) Then little children were brought to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them. Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." When he had placed his hands on them, he went on from there. 

P.S. Don't forget that the time will change on Sunday. We will turn our clocks forward one hour to local daylight time.
