This past Sunday was a wonderful celebration of children, baptism, and Northern Seminary. If you were not able to join us, I would encourage you to watch the sermon online. While you will not be able to experience the entire service, you will hear a wonderful message from a fantastic preacher. 

This week, we continue to walk through the season of Lent. We are challenged once again in our surrendering. As we study Matthew 19:16-26 together, we will consider the story of the rich young ruler. It is a familiar story, yet the challenge of this passage remains difficult. Let me invite you to take a few minutes to read the story as you prepare for worship on Sunday. I will include it here in the NTE translation.

>(Matthew 19:16-26 NTE) Suddenly a man came up to Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what good thing must I do if I'm to possess the life of the age to come?" "Why come to me with questions about what's good?" retorted Jesus. "There is One who is good! If you want to enter into life, keep the commandments." "Which ones?" he asked."These ones," Jesus answered: " “don't murder, don't commit adultery, don't steal, don't tell lies under oath,  respect your father and mother”, and “love your neighbour as yourself”." "I've, kept the lot," said the young man. "What am I still short of?" "If you want to complete the set," Jesus replied, "go and sell everything you own and give it to the poor. That way you'll, have treasure in heaven! Then come and follow me." When the young man heard him say that, he went away very sad. He had many possessions. Jesus said to his disciples, "I'm telling you the truth: it's very hard for a rich person to get into the kingdom of heaven.  Let me say it again: it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God's kingdom." The disciples were completely flabbergasted when they heard that. "So who then can be saved?" they asked. Jesus looked round at them. "Humanly speaking," he replied, "it's impossible. But everything's possible with God."
