In our second week of our study on the Holy Spirit, we discuss the work/role of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is active in our reading Scripture, speaking through his servants and our praying. As we learn more about the work of the Holy Spirit, may we increase our openness to his presence in our lives.
