Habakkuk is a little known jewel in the Old Testament. At a time when it seems that evil is winning, Habakkuk questions God. In turn, God responds to Habakkuk's doubts by revealing an unlikely plan to use evil in the world to accomplish good. As we step into the season of Advent, Habakkuk's words offer guidance as we trust that God will fulfill his promises.
