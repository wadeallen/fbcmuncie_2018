Jesus often teaches his followers through parables. In Matthew 13:24-43, Jesus describes the Kingdom of God as weeds growing beside wheat, a mustard seed becoming a large tree and yeast working its way through dough. As we reflect on these parables, we are reminded that the sometimes slow moving Kingdom is a powerful force that will one day make the world right. At the same time, we are challenged to dig deeper by asking questions and seeking God's way and will as we follow Him.
