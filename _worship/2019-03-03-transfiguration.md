The season of Epiphany ends with the story of the Transfiguration. In this story Jesus turns toward the Cross. On this dynamic occasion, Jesus takes Peter, James and John with him to the top of mountain. There they experience an impressive display of God's power, along with an affirmation of Jesus' identity. The Transfiguration reminds us of God's mission through the work of Jesus on the Cross.
