On Ascension Sunday, we find the disciples witnessing lifted into heaven. In time, Jesus' followers will be empowered by the Holy Spirit to live out God's mission in this world. We might imagine their response as one of fear and uncertainty. Yet we discover a disposition of worship as they watch Jesus disappear from thier sight. As we consider the ascension of Jesus, we are summoned to continue his mission in our world.
