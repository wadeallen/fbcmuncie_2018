Exiled on the island of Patmos, John encounters Jesus. His glory overwhelms John causing him to fall face down at his feet. Yet Jesus touches John and assures him of his eternal power. He instructs John to record this vision for the churches of Asia Minor. In doing so, John will communicate the apocalyptic vision that continues to aid us, encourage us and guide us through all times and places.
