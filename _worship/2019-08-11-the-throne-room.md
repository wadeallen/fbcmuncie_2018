The Christians in the first century were living in a world that seemed out of control. In Revelation 4, John is reminded of God's sovereignty over all things. He is invited into God's throne room and is able to see spiritual realities. As we experience this place, we are prompted to join in worship of the one who is really in charge of all things.
