As we come to Revelation 9, we are reminded of the destructive nature of evil. God unleashes evil forces in dramatic ways in this chapter. The end result might seem pointless. Repentance is rejected following intense death and destruction. Yet God's salvation story is not over. He is moving toward a saving end.
