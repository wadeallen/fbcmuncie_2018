In Revelation 11, we encounter a strange story of two witnesses who are killed, bodies exposed and then raised to life. We wonder how this account fits into the rest of Revelation. As we begin to understand how the witnesses represent the church, we see how God's redemptive plan involves his people. And when the plagues fail to bring repentance in the world, the lives of the witnesses lead to a turning around of the world.
