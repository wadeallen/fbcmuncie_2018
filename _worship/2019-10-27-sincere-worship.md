Revelation 15 is an interlude in the drama. John witnesses another sign that points to the end. He envisions a glass sea filled with faithful worshipers along with seven angels holding bowls of God's wrath. This pause allows us to reflect on the object of our worship. May we worship the one true God and deny giving our time, attention and resources to anything else.
