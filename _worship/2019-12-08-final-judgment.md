As we come to Revelation 20, we witness a chained up dragon who will be released for one final act. God allows him to escape only to be fully destroyed. Then the scene turns to the great white throne where everyone faces judgment. These scenes prepare us for the new creation in which God will restore all that was lost in Eden.
