						<p>
							The Children’s Ministry at FBC is led by a team of dedicated individuals who dearly love the youngest members of the church body. This group addresses the spiritual, emotional, and physical needs of children from infancy through 5th grade through biblical teaching, play areas with appropriate toys, aesthetically pleasing rooms, and caring, competent teens and adults from the church who have passed background checks.

							<h4>Nursery</h4>
							<p>
								Infants are cared for in our clean and quiet nursery. Walkers through 2-year-olds will be in their own room getting to practice sharing, helping, and playing together. We ask you to give detailed instructions on what your baby/toddler will need while you are away. We want to keep every child on his/her normal routine as much as possible.
							</p>
							<p>
								The 2- and 3-year-olds will be playing together and hearing a new Bible story each week. They get to listen to music, make a craft, and enjoy a snack. Please inform our volunteers of any allergies.

							<h4>Preschool</h4>
							<p>
								Our Preschool room is for ages 4-5 (children must be potty trained) They meet during our first and second service. During the early hour, the children are able to play and a lesson is provided during the late worship hour. The Preschool lessons also include making crafts, playing games and watching short stories.

							<h4>Sunday School</h4>
							<p>
								Sunday School is held during the late worship hour for children ages K-5th. The children start out in worship with parents and then are dismissed to Sunday school just before the sermon. Parents can pick up their children on the lower level following the late service.
							</p>
							<p>
								Children will get to hear a new lesson each week, have opportunities to serve in the church and community, and enjoy fellowship time with each other. We will encourage the children to read from the Bible, pray with friends, play games, be kind to others, and love and trust in the Lord.

							<h4>Children's Church</h4>
							<p>
							Children's Church is Sunday school at this time.
							</p>
							<p>
								The children will go to church with their parents until the songs of worship are finished. A teacher will be up front to escort all the children to children’s church. They will have a Bible lesson each week. Depending on the lesson, they may play a game, make a craft, watch a short story, or do other activities related to the lesson. We teach the children about how to be a part of the church and that they are all important in the eyes of Jesus.
