			<h3>Joining God in the Neighborhood</h3>
			<p>
			As mentioned in last month’s Visitor, FBC will continue the Joining God in the Neighborhood program. The purpose is to allow a time of discovery and discernment of our currentand future neighborhood needs.  We will learn how God is still at work meeting needs inour neighborhood.  We will have a two-week focus on Digging Deeper from <strong>July 14–27</strong> that will provide opportunities to learn about our neighborhood, the various ministries and services that are already being provided, and also opportunities to serve our neighbors.  This time will be different from the work sessions we did in the summer of 2017. The Joining God in the Neighborhood Team feels it is important not just to pray for or help out an organization, but really work to learn how it came about and what its mission, clients, and services are all about. At the end of the two weeks of experiences, there will be an opportunity for feedback and for people to express whether FBC can do anything more to join God in the neighborhood. It is our hope that we as a church congregation will choose to collectively become a stakeholder in our neighborhood and individually become involved and invested in our neighborhood.</p>
