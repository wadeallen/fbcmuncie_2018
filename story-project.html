			<h3>The Story Project</h3>
			<p>
				In 2019, we are embarking on what we are calling <i>The Story Project</i>. The Story Project is all about helping you discover and put into words a specific way that God has been at work in your lifeâ€”either in the past or the present. Once you see God's fingerprints, your willingness to share that with other people in our church will be an encouragement to all of us. Can we help you get started? Or do you have more questions? Your Story Team stands by ready to help: Bill Eidson, Daniel Morency, Gayle Songer, Jessica Fink, Julie Davis, Kelli Petroviak, Kelly Rodriguez, Michelle Heimlich, Molly Flodder, Sandy Davis, and Wade Allen.
